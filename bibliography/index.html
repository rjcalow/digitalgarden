      <h2>Why Our Minds Need the Wild by Lucy Jones</h2>
<p>Contemporary literary work on the British landscape tends to be a focus on nature, wilderness, or wonder. This, however, focuses on the wellbeing and health benefits of nature. Backed by scientific research, it features a substantial scientific and academic bibliography in conjunction with accessible writing.</p>
<h2>Introduction chapter</h2>
<h3>Terms</h3>
<p>Psychoterratic - mental health in relation to the earth.</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>Psychoterratic illnesses, for example, are earth-related mental health issues such as ecoanxiety and global dread.

</blockquote>
<p>Solastalgia - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151030-have-you-ever-felt-solastalgia">is when your endemic sense of place is being violated</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>‘Solastalgia’ – an admixture of solace, nostalgia and destruction – describes a feeling of nostalgia and powerlessness about a place that once brought solace which has been destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Species loneliness:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>...to mean a collective sorrow and anxiety arising from our disconnection from other species.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed and agreed with this:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>...it would appear that industrialized society perceives nature to be little more than a nicety: a luxury, an extra, a garnish – ‘Green crap’, as the former prime minister David Cameron reportedly called environmental policies
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Brief timeline of cultures relationship with nature</h3>
<p>Arcadia:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>Virgil’s account of Arcadia, from his Eclogues (also known as the Bucolics), was a landscape of comfort and healing – with its cool springs, zephyrs, laurels and tamarisks – for Gallus, who was dying of a broken heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Industrialization:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>...as the West became industrialized and our contact and connection with the natural world around us dwindled. As people moved to cities, and away from the land, they had to actively seek out nature, as they became physically separated from it. In the pre-industrialized West, the wilderness was often seen as cruel, revolting and ugly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romanization of nature:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>from the eighteenth century onwards people began to see the natural landscape in a new way, and with the rise of the Romantic movement in art and poetry, and Transcendentalists such as Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a brief timeline, Jones discusses post-industrial attitudes to nature and mental health with Victorian/Edwardian asylums having gardens. Followed by contemporary nature therapy and the authors personal interest. </p>

<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>Our microbiota are healthiest when they are diverse – and a diverse microbiota is influenced positively by an environment filled with organisms, which are found more abundantly in outside spaces than inside.</p>

<p>Jones shares Tim Ingold's analogy "...these histories are woven, along with the life-cycles of plants and animals, into the texture of the surface itself (Ingold, 2000, p. 198)."</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>we are woven into the land, and wider ecosystems, more than we realize</p>

<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>In animal studies, T-cells (cells which modulate the immune system) have a surprisingly long half-life of <strong>twenty-seven days</strong>. This suggests that your post-gardening high could keep you buzzing for days, or even weeks.</p>

      <h2>Jorgensen, A. and Tylecote, M. (2007), Landscape Research, 32(4), pp. 443–462</h2>
<p>A paper, preluding the Urban Wildscape anthology, that discusses ambivalent responses to contemporary urban landscapes where nature is in control. Furthermore, a wilderness is discussed in relation to successional nature found in urban interstitial spaces. Being that ambivalency is a core theme in relation to the urban landscape, this paper was appropriate reading for my essay as well as an introduction to historic anthropocentric views on land and nature. Some of the references and themes are featured and expanded within Jorgensen’s Urban landscape, however, this paper on its own has merit given its focus on liminal ambivalence and ambiguity in relation to culture and nature.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>From early on in northwest European culture, distinctions have been made between the cultivated area under human control and the surrounding wilderness. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) (1989) defines a wilderness as ‘‘a wild or uncultivated region or tract of land, uninhabited, or inhabited only by wild animals; ‘a tract of solitude or savageness’ (quoted from Johnson’s dictionary)’’. Wilderness is therefore not only the antithesis of human habitation and cultivation, but is also the haunt of wild animals, and may be a place of savagery and danger. (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445).</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>The idea of wilderness as outside of and opposed to civilization was informed by an anthropocentric world view which sorted the world and everything in it into things humans could derive benefit from, which were therefore good, and things that were useless, which were consequently imbued with moral badness. Thus wilderness, including woodland, was not just outside of civilization, it was an affront to it, and it was a human duty to eradicate it, if the land could be put to better use, which was usually to fields, but the metal industries and especially iron smelting had also taken a heavy toll on forests in England by the 13th century (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 447).</p>
<p>Just as the pre-modern terra nullius was regarded as a void awaiting colonization and exploitation, so contemporary wasteland is frequently regarded as a non-entity, fit for nothing but improvement or development; and as with the old terra nullius, it is often shown as literally blank space on maps and plans (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 452).</p>
<p><mark>If natural and human influences are all mixed up it is impossible to tell whether humans are in control.</mark> (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445)</p>
<p>The apparent relaxation of legal and social conventions in interstitial spaces creates welcome opportunities for people to do things that they would not be able to do in any other urban setting, such as young people gathering and travellers setting up encampments (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445).</p>

        <h2 class="w3-bottombar w3-border-gark-grey " style="">Haila, Y. (2000) ‘Beyond The Nature-Culture Dualism’</h2>  </a></div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<h4>Haila uses straightforward language in the opening paragraph to describe the dichotomy:</h4>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>Culture may be viewed as an agent that actively strives for domination over nature, or as a malicious tumor that tends to grow and exceed the limits set by nature. Nature may be regarded as a source of hardships and catastrophs that needs to be mastered by human rational action or, alternatively, as benign providence that offers advice. The common denominator of all these varieties is that culture and nature are opposite sides in a dualism. (Haila, 2000, p. 155)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Nature as the “other”:</h4>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>On the level of cultural identity, nature is such an “other”. The relationship to the “other” is asymmetric and implies domination; Plumwood (1993) elaborates on this point. For instance, in oppositions such as male-female, city-country, and reason-emotion the second term is the “other” for the first one which is the dominant term. Similarly, culture, by being the sphere in which human historical identity is formed, is dominant to its “other”, nature; culture becomes a “something” in opposition to “something else” which is nature… (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haila points to Descartes and cartesian thinking:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>Subject-object relationships and the ensuing dualisms become elevated to a metaphysical postulate that the subject-object dichotomy is an essential determinant of human existence. We owe this move largely to Descartes who drew a strict distinction between res cogitas and res extensa; the apparent necessity as well as the inadequacy of the Cartesian dualism have been recognized and analyzed by a number of authors (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Pervasive dualism</h2>
<p>Haila is concerned with the effects of the dualism on Environmentalism:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>The form particularly relevant in ecological thinking in the era of the ecological crisis is as follows: We want to know what nature allows us. To reach an ultimate certainty we would like to distinguish between “nature by herself as a standard” and “nature modified and polluted by humans”. This, however, cannot be done. Humans are creatures of nature; consequently, discriminating between phenomena of nature as “natural” and phenomena of culture as “unnatural” does not make sense at all. Furthermore, as nature changes continuously due to natural processes, the fact that human actions change nature cannot be a diagnostic feature of their “unnaturalness” (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haila’s argument that we want to standardise nature, reminds me of Monbiot’s arguments against idealistic conservation:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>… the conservation movement, while well intentioned, sought to freeze living systems in time. It attempts to prevent animals and plants from either leaving or–if they do not live there already–entering. It seeks to manage nature as if tending a garden (Monbiot, 2014, p. 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haila points to the models of first and second nature to deconstruct the dualism:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>First nature and second nature form historically unique combinations in different situations and cannot be separated from each other: where, then, is the nature-culture dualism? (Haila, 2000, p. 168).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Haila concludes that the boundary caused by the dualism should be thought of as complex interactions, breaking down the individual and the collective systems: </p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>… <mark> the dualism may not be one but many </mark>, constructed in every instantiation anew albeit from common materials … the composition and structure of the materials have varied enormously through history. It is not quite obvious whether “nature” has been the same in different cultures except in the abstract sense of being outside each culture, and in the even more abstract sense of being part of the same physical reality  (Haila, 2000, pp. 163–164).</p>
<p>...instead of assuming at the outset that humanity and nature form two distinct realms of reality, we ought to view them as merging into situated, historically and contextually specified complexes. Then, the assumed fixed boundary between “I” and “the world” looses meaning (Haila, 2000, p. 171).</p>

      <h2>Jorgensen, A. and Keenan, R.</h2>
<p>An anthology of essays discussing urban margins and interstices as urban wildscapes, ambiguous places where users subvert authority and seek recreation in the unregulated territory and autonomous nature. The definition is similar to Shoard, M. (2000) [[Edgelands of Promise]], however, the focus is not on interfacial space but a wider breadth of urban spaces that have a natural agency shaping the land.</p>
<p>Broken into three parts, theorising, case studies and implications for practice, the anthology challenges preconceptions of urban space with the aim of convincing the reader (architects, urban planners, academics, perhaps artists) to engage with autonomous nature through a dichotomous conception of culture and nature. The contributors are from a wide range of disciplines from environmentalists, academic researchers, social scientists, artists, architects and landscape planners. The wide breadth gives the anthology a significant weight for defining these spaces. Additionally, the large number of international contributions, both author and subject wise, provides a western post-industrial perspective with different viewpoints from US and European perspectives. Of the contributions, Jorgensen’s introduction is relatable with its photographic illustrations of Sheffield -locations and scenes I am familiar with, while ‘Places to be wild in nature’ by  Thompson, C. W explores societies relationship with the natural world through public open spaces, ‘Learning from Detroit’ by Woodward, C looks to the post-industrial rust belt of Detroit and its contemporary ruins for inspiration as tourism and urban gardening activities are carried out.</p>

      <h3>Roberts, M. S. and Farley, P. (2011).</h3>
<p>An anthology of essays by English poets, Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts, on the subject of Edgeland -a term originally defined by Marion Shoard for interfacial spaces between urban and rural. The authors use the term, explore the etymology and the characteristics of the space within individual essays, under short direct titles such as paths, dens, gardens and woodlands. The author’s voice, which is indistinguishable with Farley and Roberts writing as one, is melancholic and romantic yet descriptive and accurate of the spaces themselves with the intended audience of psychogeographers and landscape narrative fiction. Farley and Roberts criticise contemporary landscape authors for romanticising wilderness within the British landscape as a misanthropic fascination rather than taking advantage of nearby nature in the Edgelands. The authors also criticise psychogeographer authors and their use of Edgelands as a backdrop and a means of negative misanthropic observations</p>

      <h3>Shoard, M. (2000), Landscapes, pp. 117–146.</h3>
<p>Marion Shoard’s defining edgelands essay in which observations on the interfacial landscape between urban and rural characterize the space and are argued as spaces for wildlife and plants, in the process questioning if these sites need protection from planners. Though written in 2000 it is still relevant today and is often cited within contemporary work on Edgelands.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>The edgelands ... are raw and rough, and rather than seeming people-friendly they are often sombre and menacing, flaunting their participation in activities we do not wholly understand. They certainly do not conform to people’s idea of the picturesque by presenting a chocolate-box image, suitably composed and textural. On the contrary, they seem desolate, forsaken and unconnected even to their own elements let alone to our preferred version of human life. (Shoard, 2000, p. 121)</p>
<p>The subversiveness of interfacial land perhaps explains why children often value it more than other groups, seeming to find the edgelands a wonderful place to play. Why? This landscape offers an obviously varied environment which is often wild, with plenty of places to hide and things to play with. Its dereliction stimulates the imagination. This seems to apply not only to children but also to some kinds of creative artist. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)</p>
<p>The aura of excitement which goes with the apparent lawlessness of the edgelands has been exploited in such films of the 1990s as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Things to Do in Denver When you’re Dead, Fargo and The Straight Story. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)</p>
<p>Interfacial sites often enjoy biological diversity partly because they are ignored. Being ignored, they go unmanaged. The clutter of the interface, which would be tidied out of sight by 
those concerned with creating an acceptable landscape there, often enhances wildlife by creating new niches which wild creatures can exploit. (Shoard, 2000, p. 129)</p>

      <h3>Symmons Roberts, M. (2016), in Habermann, I. and Keller, D. (eds) English Topographies in Literature and Culture.</h3>
<p>This keynote originally for the University of Basel, as stated in title, reads as a making-of and commentation of Symmons Roberts co-authored work (2011) Edgelands. Symmons Roberts discusses the rationale, influences and the work itself while providing insight and perspective on the Edgeland space. As the work is more recent than his earlier work (2011) Edgelands and Shoard’s (2000) Edgelands of Promise, this paper reinforces the Edgelands as a contemporary concept. Additionally, Roberts writes about the wilderness aspect of the neglected interfacial space and the subversive edge characteristic. While the language is clear-cut it does not deviate from northern post-industrial sensibility established by the 2011 work, therefore can be seen as an epilogue to the later.</p>
<h1>Quotes</h1>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>In England, they [edgelands] are those interfacial territories that do not fit the titles ‘urban’ or ‘rural’. Largely unplanned, often unwatched, derelict in parts, rapidly shifting with the economic tide, these are places commonly assumed to grow in rings around the edges of towns and cities, defined by what they contain. (Roberts, 2016, p. 18)</p>
<p>England’s edgelands refuse to be held in a tight circle around our urban borders. … In many English cities, the edgelands have refused to remain in the border zone between the outlying housing estates and the first steps of farmland. In some cities, like Manchester and Liverpool, we found them in pockets.  (Roberts, 2016, p. 18)</p>
<p>If the edgelands are not necessarily (or at least, not solely) at the edges of towns and cities, then how are they to be identified? (Roberts, 2016, p. 19)</p>
<p>Marion Shoard’s coining of ‘edgelands’ seemed to conjure exactly our experience of these places. They were, and are, edgy. In British tv drama and low budget films, the edgelands are always the place of the dénouement, the place where the drug gang is busted, the car chase ends, or the kidnap victim is rescued. These are places where anything could happen. And when it did, it was usually illegal or contravened every rule of health and safety. This sense of the edgelands as a dystopian landscape is a familiar trope of British popular culture in particular. (Roberts, 2016, pp. 19–20)</p>
<p>... the edgelands were not simply dystopias. They were the places where, as children, we felt free and inspired. (Roberts, 2016, p. 20)</p>
<p>Why then use the word ‘wilderness’ at all in relation to the edgelands? Well, it is partly their lack of honouring, of lifting up, even of documentation. If a stretch of edgelands – say, the stretch around Barton Bridge on the M60 outside Manchester – is less walked through, less watched, less written about and less managed than a Highlands glen, then is it not more worthy of the term ‘wilderness’? Add to that the un-named qualities of England’s edgelands, and the case is very strong. A place with pools, woodlands, ruins and meadows all without names sounds pretty much like a wilderness to me. (Roberts, 2016, p. 21)</p>

      <h2>Wells, L. (2011)</h2>
<p>An anthology of landscape photography essays written by Liz Wells, an established professor in photographic culture who also edited two popular academic books <em>The Photography Reader</em> and <em>Photography: A Critical Introduction.</em> This anthology, like previous, provides an academic and extensive analysis of its subject both historically and contemporary. The first essay <em>Landscape: Time, Space, Place, Aesthetics</em> is an introductory argument that landscape is a physical space given meaning through human ideological processes. Landscape as art, through a historical narrative, is discussed in relation to landscape as a construct, the values of which are reiterated through representational aesthetics in art. Another essay of interest is <em>Pastoral Heritage: Britain viewed through a critical lens</em> which argues that all land, even the coastal seas, in Britain is managed and <em>landscaped</em> through multi-layered socio-cultural legacies of which are amplified through the scarcity of the island land conveying monetary cultural attitudes and power and therefore celebrating it. The essays interpretation of the British landscape as a constructed land informs and justifies my works contextual narrative of managed and non-managed space.</p>
<p>Wells enforcing landscape as a social construct:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>Representation of land as landscape, whether in romantic or in more topographic modes, reflects and reinforces contemporary political, social and environmental attitudes.” (Wells, 2011, p. 1)</p>
<p>Landscape is a social product; particular landscapes tell us something about cultural histories and attitudes. Landscape results from human intervention to shape or transform natural phenomena, of which we are simultaneously a part. A basic useful definition of landscape thus would be vistas encompassing both nature and the changes that humans have effected on the natural world. (Wells, 2011, pp. 1–2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the notion of ‘space’ and ‘place’ Wells notes that history turns one into the other:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>History turns space into place. This simple statement masks a complexity of ideological processes associated with the relation of humankind and our environment. (Wells, 2011, p. 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wells states that landscape images are representations but also responses to space:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>Landscape pictures thus centrally contribute to the representation of space as place and, crucially, imply responses to particular places. (Wells, 2011, p. 25)</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>“a conceptual framework consisting of four factors: (1) qualities of the space; (2) types of activity; (3) time and duration of activities; and (4) originator of the activity.” (Franck, 2013, p. 154)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Franck focuses on activities carried out within the space:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>“Activities, not only spaces, are prominent in the framework I have outlined, for it is through their actions that people produce a space, often regardless of its name or intended purposes” (Franck, 2013, p. 168)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Franck singles out the wild and overgrown for signs of abandonment:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>“Whether the sites are empty buildings, remnants of buildings, empty land, or some combination, they are frequently derelict and deteriorated, possibly wild and overgrown. The wildness, the strange configurations of building remnants and overgrown trees and plants and mysterious clues to past uses all make such sites extremely interesting to explore” (Franck, 2013, p. 154)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terrain vague space is unoccupied and free like many public spaces:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>“Curiously enough, this is a quality of most traditional public spaces as well: sidewalks, squares, and parks are highly accessible and easily appropriated for activities they were not intended to accommodate, activities that may then be contested by the authorities.” (Franck, 2013, p. 156)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some public spaces do not have any uses:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>“Some leftover public spaces, often next to transit routes or at the edges of bodies of water, have no intended use whatsoever, being then even emptier and more available for appropriation than other public spaces” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terrain vague spaces “exist outside the city’s effective circuits and productive structures”:</p>
<blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
<p>“This marginality could be geographic, economic, social, or temporal. Abandoned industrial sites may be geographically remote from the current everyday life of the city and not easily visible or controllable. They may also be socially and economically marginal, as they are remote from daily life and produce no revenue.” (Franck, 2013, p. 157)</p>
