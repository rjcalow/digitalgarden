            <blockquote>
<p>Landscapes are culture before they are nature; constructs of the imagination projected onto wood and water and rock. So goes the argument of this book. But it should also be acknowledged that once a certain  idea of landscape, a myth, a vision, establishes itself in an actual place, it has a peculiar way of muddling categories, of making metaphors more real than their referents; of becoming, in fact, part of the scenery.</p>

            <h3>Why Our Minds Need the Wild by Lucy Jones</h3>
<p>Contemporary literary work on the British landscape tends to be a focus on nature, wilderness, or wonder. This, however, focuses on the wellbeing and health benefits of nature. Backed by scientific research, it features a substantial scientific and academic bibliography in conjunction with accessible writing.</p>
<h3>Introduction chapter</h3>
<h4>Terms</h4>
<p>Psychoterratic - mental health in relation to the earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychoterratic illnesses, for example, are earth-related mental health issues such as ecoanxiety and global dread.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solastalgia - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151030-have-you-ever-felt-solastalgia">is when your endemic sense of place is being violated</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Solastalgia’ – an admixture of solace, nostalgia and destruction – describes a feeling of nostalgia and powerlessness about a place that once brought solace which has been destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Species loneliness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...to mean a collective sorrow and anxiety arising from our disconnection from other species.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed and agreed with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...it would appear that industrialized society perceives nature to be little more than a nicety: a luxury, an extra, a garnish – ‘Green crap’, as the former prime minister David Cameron reportedly called environmental policies
</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Brief timeline of cultures relationship with nature</h4>
<p>Arcadia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virgil’s account of Arcadia, from his Eclogues (also known as the Bucolics), was a landscape of comfort and healing – with its cool springs, zephyrs, laurels and tamarisks – for Gallus, who was dying of a broken heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Industrialization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...as the West became industrialized and our contact and connection with the natural world around us dwindled. As people moved to cities, and away from the land, they had to actively seek out nature, as they became physically separated from it. In the pre-industrialized West, the wilderness was often seen as cruel, revolting and ugly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romanization of nature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from the eighteenth century onwards people began to see the natural landscape in a new way, and with the rise of the Romantic movement in art and poetry, and Transcendentalists such as Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a brief timeline, Jones discusses post-industrial attitudes to nature and mental health with Victorian/Edwardian asylums having gardens. Followed by contemporary nature therapy and the authors personal interest. </p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<h4>Mycobacterium vaccae:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>hypothesize that an immune response to M. vaccae stimulates the brain to create more serotonin, the happy chemical that antidepressant pills are designed to boost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;/ br&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our microbiota are healthiest when they are diverse – and a diverse microbiota is influenced positively by an environment filled with organisms, which are found more abundantly in outside spaces than inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones shares Tim Ingold's analogy "...these histories are woven, along with the life-cycles of plants and animals, into the texture of the surface itself (Ingold, 2000, p. 198)."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we are woven into the land, and wider ecosystems, more than we realize</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figures</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies show that just <strong>two hours</strong> in a forest can significantly lower cytokine levels in the blood, soothing inflammation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;/ br&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In animal studies, T-cells (cells which modulate the immune system) have a surprisingly long half-life of <strong>twenty-seven days</strong>. This suggests that your post-gardening high could keep you buzzing for days, or even weeks.</p>

              >
            </h1>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
<h5>Haila uses straightforward language in the opening paragraph to describe the dichotomy:</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Culture may be viewed as an agent that actively strives for domination over nature, or as a malicious tumor that tends to grow and exceed the limits set by nature. Nature may be regarded as a source of hardships and catastrophs that needs to be mastered by human rational action or, alternatively, as benign providence that offers advice. The common denominator of all these varieties is that culture and nature are opposite sides in a dualism. (Haila, 2000, p. 155)</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Nature as the “other”:</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>On the level of cultural identity, nature is such an “other”. The relationship to the “other” is asymmetric and implies domination; Plumwood (1993) elaborates on this point. For instance, in oppositions such as male-female, city-country, and reason-emotion the second term is the “other” for the first one which is the dominant term. Similarly, culture, by being the sphere in which human historical identity is formed, is dominant to its “other”, nature; culture becomes a “something” in opposition to “something else” which is nature… (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haila points to Descartes and cartesian thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject-object relationships and the ensuing dualisms become elevated to a metaphysical postulate that the subject-object dichotomy is an essential determinant of human existence. We owe this move largely to Descartes who drew a strict distinction between res cogitas and res extensa; the apparent necessity as well as the inadequacy of the Cartesian dualism have been recognized and analyzed by a number of authors (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pervasive dualism</h3>
<p>Haila is concerned with the effects of the dualism on Environmentalism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The form particularly relevant in ecological thinking in the era of the ecological crisis is as follows: We want to know what nature allows us. To reach an ultimate certainty we would like to distinguish between “nature by herself as a standard” and “nature modified and polluted by humans”. This, however, cannot be done. Humans are creatures of nature; consequently, discriminating between phenomena of nature as “natural” and phenomena of culture as “unnatural” does not make sense at all. Furthermore, as nature changes continuously due to natural processes, the fact that human actions change nature cannot be a diagnostic feature of their “unnaturalness” (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haila’s argument that we want to standardise nature, reminds me of Monbiot’s arguments against idealistic conservation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the conservation movement, while well intentioned, sought to freeze living systems in time. It attempts to prevent animals and plants from either leaving or–if they do not live there already–entering. It seeks to manage nature as if tending a garden (Monbiot, 2014, p. 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haila points to the models of first and second nature to deconstruct the dualism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First nature and second nature form historically unique combinations in different situations and cannot be separated from each other: where, then, is the nature-culture dualism? (Haila, 2000, p. 168).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Haila concludes that the boundary caused by the dualism should be thought of as complex interactions, breaking down the individual and the collective systems: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>… <mark> the dualism may not be one but many </mark>, constructed in every instantiation anew albeit from common materials … the composition and structure of the materials have varied enormously through history. It is not quite obvious whether “nature” has been the same in different cultures except in the abstract sense of being outside each culture, and in the even more abstract sense of being part of the same physical reality  (Haila, 2000, pp. 163–164).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...instead of assuming at the outset that humanity and nature form two distinct realms of reality, we ought to view them as merging into situated, historically and contextually specified complexes. Then, the assumed fixed boundary between “I” and “the world” looses meaning (Haila, 2000, p. 171).</p>

            <h4>Regarding nature and culture dichotomy</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of a nature–culture dualism that has been eroded by historical events, a broad movement across the social sciences and social theory has advanced the claim that the world has always been comprised of entanglements between humans, creatures and agents of all kinds. This movement has been inspired by the philosophies of, among others, Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway and Gilles Deleuze and their antipathy to ontological hygiene. (Ginn, 2017, p. 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ginn points to philosophers such as Bruno Latour, who’s 1991 work, <em>Nous n'avons jamais été modernes</em>, argues the dichotomy never existed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>… nature and culture are conceptual abstractions and so our present era – although it is an era of great loss – is not a loss of the wild brought about by the enclosure of nature within culture. Rather, the twenty-first century has witnessed a step-change in the intensity of planetary circulation and metabolism (Ginn, 2017, p. 5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ginn states that culture has not consumed nature (extinctions), but connected with nature through an increasing number of interconnections at a global level. This reminds me of fig.1.1 in Latours translated, <em>We have never been modern?</em> (Latour, 1993, p. 11) in which nonhuman nature and human culture are depicted along a second dichotomy separating the nature-culture dualism with that of a hybridised network of connections. </p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../../imgs/333443243.jpg" /><figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Gardening shrugs in the face of the nature–culture dualism. Gardening has never really been something done by humans to plants, but has always been a process of mutually beneficial interkingdom exchange. (Ginn, 2017, p. 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to [[gardening]], the interconnections between nature-culture are apparent and beneficial for both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Anthropocene seems to unite humanity. But it does so through ‘our’ unequally shared vulnerability to forces of capitalist world ecology and global environmental change. Instead of being united by negative unity – that of vulnerability and loss – might we not seek a more compassionate and affirmative acknowledgement of unity? Gardening, as the domestic wild, might allow us a way to imagine an earthly ethos fit for the Anthropocene. (Ginn, 2017, p. 142)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ginn’s concluding message is that gardening may provide a force for good in the anthropocene landscape as a positive interconnection between nonhuman and human culture. </p>
