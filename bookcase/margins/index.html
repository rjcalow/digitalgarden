        <h3>Jorgensen, A. and Tylecote, M. (2007), Landscape Research, 32(4), pp. 443‚Äì462</h3>
<p>A paper, preluding the Urban Wildscape anthology, that discusses ambivalent responses to contemporary urban landscapes where nature is in control. Furthermore, a wilderness is discussed in relation to successional nature found in urban interstitial spaces. Being that ambivalency is a core theme in relation to the urban landscape, this paper was appropriate reading for my essay as well as an introduction to historic anthropocentric views on land and nature. Some of the references and themes are featured and expanded within Jorgensen‚Äôs Urban landscape, however, this paper on its own has merit given its focus on liminal ambivalence and ambiguity in relation to culture and nature.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>From early on in northwest European culture, distinctions have been made between the cultivated area under human control and the surrounding wilderness. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) (1989) defines a wilderness as ‚Äò‚Äòa wild or uncultivated region or tract of land, uninhabited, or inhabited only by wild animals; ‚Äòa tract of solitude or savageness‚Äô (quoted from Johnson‚Äôs dictionary)‚Äô‚Äô. Wilderness is therefore not only the antithesis of human habitation and cultivation, but is also the haunt of wild animals, and may be a place of savagery and danger. (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445).</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea of wilderness as outside of and opposed to civilization was informed by an anthropocentric world view which sorted the world and everything in it into things humans could derive benefit from, which were therefore good, and things that were useless, which were consequently imbued with moral badness. Thus wilderness, including woodland, was not just outside of civilization, it was an affront to it, and it was a human duty to eradicate it, if the land could be put to better use, which was usually to fields, but the metal industries and especially iron smelting had also taken a heavy toll on forests in England by the 13th century (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 447).</p>
<p>Just as the pre-modern terra nullius was regarded as a void awaiting colonization and exploitation, so contemporary wasteland is frequently regarded as a non-entity, fit for nothing but improvement or development; and as with the old terra nullius, it is often shown as literally blank space on maps and plans (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 452).</p>
<p><mark>If natural and human influences are all mixed up it is impossible to tell whether humans are in control.</mark> (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445)</p>
<p>The apparent relaxation of legal and social conventions in interstitial spaces creates welcome opportunities for people to do things that they would not be able to do in any other urban setting, such as young people gathering and travellers setting up encampments (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445).</p>

        </h1>

        <h3>Jorgensen, A. and Keenan, R.</h3>
<p>An anthology of essays discussing urban margins and interstices as urban wildscapes, ambiguous places where users subvert authority and seek recreation in the unregulated territory and autonomous nature. The definition is similar to Shoard, M. (2000) [[<a href="#Urban-WildscapesNotes">Edgelands of Promise</a>]], however, the focus is not on interfacial space but a wider breadth of urban spaces that have a natural agency shaping the land.</p>
<p>Broken into three parts, theorising, case studies and implications for practice, the anthology challenges preconceptions of urban space with the aim of convincing the reader (architects, urban planners, academics, perhaps artists) to engage with autonomous nature through a dichotomous conception of culture and nature. The contributors are from a wide range of disciplines from environmentalists, academic researchers, social scientists, artists, architects and landscape planners. The wide breadth gives the anthology a significant weight for defining these spaces. Additionally, the large number of international contributions, both author and subject wise, provides a western post-industrial perspective with different viewpoints from US and European perspectives. Of the contributions, Jorgensen‚Äôs introduction is relatable with its photographic illustrations of Sheffield -locations and scenes I am familiar with, while ‚ÄòPlaces to be wild in nature‚Äô by  Thompson, C. W explores societies relationship with the natural world through public open spaces, ‚ÄòLearning from Detroit‚Äô by Woodward, C looks to the post-industrial rust belt of Detroit and its contemporary ruins for inspiration as tourism and urban gardening activities are carried out.</p>

        <h4>Roberts, M. S. and Farley, P. (2011).</h4>
<p>An anthology of essays by English poets, Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts, on the subject of Edgeland -a term originally defined by Marion Shoard for interfacial spaces between urban and rural. The authors use the term, explore the etymology and the characteristics of the space within individual essays, under short direct titles such as paths, dens, gardens and woodlands. The author‚Äôs voice, which is indistinguishable with Farley and Roberts writing as one, is melancholic and romantic yet descriptive and accurate of the spaces themselves with the intended audience of psychogeographers and landscape narrative fiction. Farley and Roberts criticise contemporary landscape authors for romanticising wilderness within the British landscape as a misanthropic fascination rather than taking advantage of nearby nature in the Edgelands. The authors also criticise psychogeographer authors and their use of Edgelands as a backdrop and a means of negative misanthropic observations</p>

        <h4>Shoard, M. (2000), Landscapes, pp. 117‚Äì146.</h4>
<p>Marion Shoard‚Äôs defining edgelands essay in which observations on the interfacial landscape between urban and rural characterize the space and are argued as spaces for wildlife and plants, in the process questioning if these sites need protection from planners. Though written in 2000 it is still relevant today and is often cited within contemporary work on Edgelands.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The edgelands ... are raw and rough, and rather than seeming people-friendly they are often sombre and menacing, flaunting their participation in activities we do not wholly understand. They certainly do not conform to people‚Äôs idea of the picturesque by presenting a chocolate-box image, suitably composed and textural. On the contrary, they seem desolate, forsaken and unconnected even to their own elements let alone to our preferred version of human life. (Shoard, 2000, p. 121)</p>
<p>The subversiveness of interfacial land perhaps explains why children often value it more than other groups, seeming to find the edgelands a wonderful place to play. Why? This landscape offers an obviously varied environment which is often wild, with plenty of places to hide and things to play with. Its dereliction stimulates the imagination. This seems to apply not only to children but also to some kinds of creative artist. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)</p>
<p>The aura of excitement which goes with the apparent lawlessness of the edgelands has been exploited in such films of the 1990s as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Things to Do in Denver When you‚Äôre Dead, Fargo and The Straight Story. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)</p>
<p>Interfacial sites often enjoy biological diversity partly because they are ignored. Being ignored, they go unmanaged. The clutter of the interface, which would be tidied out of sight by 
those concerned with creating an acceptable landscape there, often enhances wildlife by creating new niches which wild creatures can exploit. (Shoard, 2000, p. 129)</p>

        <h4>Symmons Roberts, M. (2016), in Habermann, I. and Keller, D. (eds) English Topographies in Literature and Culture.</h4>
<p>This keynote originally for the University of Basel, as stated in title, reads as a making-of and commentation of Symmons Roberts co-authored work (2011) Edgelands. Symmons Roberts discusses the rationale, influences and the work itself while providing insight and perspective on the Edgeland space. As the work is more recent than his earlier work (2011) Edgelands and Shoard‚Äôs (2000) Edgelands of Promise, this paper reinforces the Edgelands as a contemporary concept. Additionally, Roberts writes about the wilderness aspect of the neglected interfacial space and the subversive edge characteristic. While the language is clear-cut it does not deviate from northern post-industrial sensibility established by the 2011 work, therefore can be seen as an epilogue to the later.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In England, they [edgelands] are those interfacial territories that do not fit the titles ‚Äòurban‚Äô or ‚Äòrural‚Äô. Largely unplanned, often unwatched, derelict in parts, rapidly shifting with the economic tide, these are places commonly assumed to grow in rings around the edges of towns and cities, defined by what they contain. (Roberts, 2016, p. 18)</p>
<p>England‚Äôs edgelands refuse to be held in a tight circle around our urban borders. ‚Ä¶ In many English cities, the edgelands have refused to remain in the border zone between the outlying housing estates and the first steps of farmland. In some cities, like Manchester and Liverpool, we found them in pockets.  (Roberts, 2016, p. 18)</p>
<p>If the edgelands are not necessarily (or at least, not solely) at the edges of towns and cities, then how are they to be identified? (Roberts, 2016, p. 19)</p>
<p>Marion Shoard‚Äôs coining of ‚Äòedgelands‚Äô seemed to conjure exactly our experience of these places. They were, and are, edgy. In British tv drama and low budget films, the edgelands are always the place of the d√©nouement, the place where the drug gang is busted, the car chase ends, or the kidnap victim is rescued. These are places where anything could happen. And when it did, it was usually illegal or contravened every rule of health and safety. This sense of the edgelands as a dystopian landscape is a familiar trope of British popular culture in particular. (Roberts, 2016, pp. 19‚Äì20)</p>
<p>... the edgelands were not simply dystopias. They were the places where, as children, we felt free and inspired. (Roberts, 2016, p. 20)</p>
<p>Why then use the word ‚Äòwilderness‚Äô at all in relation to the edgelands? Well, it is partly their lack of honouring, of lifting up, even of documentation. If a stretch of edgelands ‚Äì say, the stretch around Barton Bridge on the M60 outside Manchester ‚Äì is less walked through, less watched, less written about and less managed than a Highlands glen, then is it not more worthy of the term ‚Äòwilderness‚Äô? Add to that the un-named qualities of England‚Äôs edgelands, and the case is very strong. A place with pools, woodlands, ruins and meadows all without names sounds pretty much like a wilderness to me. (Roberts, 2016, p. 21)</p>

        <h3>Wells, L. (2011)</h3>
<p>An anthology of landscape photography essays written by Liz Wells, an established professor in photographic culture who also edited two popular academic books <em>The Photography Reader</em> and <em>Photography: A Critical Introduction.</em> This anthology, like previous, provides an academic and extensive analysis of its subject both historically and contemporary. The first essay <em>Landscape: Time, Space, Place, Aesthetics</em> is an introductory argument that landscape is a physical space given meaning through human ideological processes. Landscape as art, through a historical narrative, is discussed in relation to landscape as a construct, the values of which are reiterated through representational aesthetics in art. Another essay of interest is <em>Pastoral Heritage: Britain viewed through a critical lens</em> which argues that all land, even the coastal seas, in Britain is managed and <em>landscaped</em> through multi-layered socio-cultural legacies of which are amplified through the scarcity of the island land conveying monetary cultural attitudes and power and therefore celebrating it. The essays interpretation of the British landscape as a constructed land informs and justifies my works contextual narrative of managed and non-managed space.</p>
<p>Wells enforcing landscape as a social construct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Representation of land as landscape, whether in romantic or in more topographic modes, reflects and reinforces contemporary political, social and environmental attitudes.‚Äù (Wells, 2011, p. 1)</p>
<p>Landscape is a social product; particular landscapes tell us something about cultural histories and attitudes. Landscape results from human intervention to shape or transform natural phenomena, of which we are simultaneously a part. A basic useful definition of landscape thus would be vistas encompassing both nature and the changes that humans have effected on the natural world. (Wells, 2011, pp. 1‚Äì2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the notion of ‚Äòspace‚Äô and ‚Äòplace‚Äô Wells notes that history turns one into the other:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>History turns space into place. This simple statement masks a complexity of ideological processes associated with the relation of humankind and our environment. (Wells, 2011, p. 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wells states that landscape images are representations but also responses to space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landscape pictures thus centrally contribute to the representation of space as place and, crucially, imply responses to particular places. (Wells, 2011, p. 25)</p>

<p>‚Äúa conceptual framework consisting of four factors: (1) qualities of the space; (2) types of activity; (3) time and duration of activities; and (4) originator of the activity.‚Äù (Franck, 2013, p. 154)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Franck focuses on activities carried out within the space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúActivities, not only spaces, are prominent in the framework I have outlined, for it is through their actions that people produce a space, often regardless of its name or intended purposes‚Äù (Franck, 2013, p. 168)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Franck singles out the wild and overgrown for signs of abandonment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWhether the sites are empty buildings, remnants of buildings, empty land, or some combination, they are frequently derelict and deteriorated, possibly wild and overgrown. The wildness, the strange configurations of building remnants and overgrown trees and plants and mysterious clues to past uses all make such sites extremely interesting to explore‚Äù (Franck, 2013, p. 154)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terrain vague space is unoccupied and free like many public spaces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúCuriously enough, this is a quality of most traditional public spaces as well: sidewalks, squares, and parks are highly accessible and easily appropriated for activities they were not intended to accommodate, activities that may then be contested by the authorities.‚Äù (Franck, 2013, p. 156)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some public spaces do not have any uses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúSome leftover public spaces, often next to transit routes or at the edges of bodies of water, have no intended use whatsoever, being then even emptier and more available for appropriation than other public spaces‚Äù </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terrain vague spaces ‚Äúexist outside the city‚Äôs effective circuits and productive structures‚Äù:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThis marginality could be geographic, economic, social, or temporal. Abandoned industrial sites may be geographically remote from the current everyday life of the city and not easily visible or controllable. They may also be socially and economically marginal, as they are remote from daily life and produce no revenue.‚Äù (Franck, 2013, p. 157)</p>
