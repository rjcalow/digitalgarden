<p>Notes on stinkhorns: starts its life cycle as an egg-like fungus, then leaves the ground as a phallus which smells like rotting meat. The aroma lures insects like blowflies to a surgery liquid laced with spores. The  spores piggyback on the fly to other areas like dung. It’s edible (but  why would you?) at the egg stage. Found in broadleaf and coniferous  woodlands. Sometimes I see them in late autumn within edgeland  plantations.</p>

          <h1>The poppy</h1>
        </a>

        <p>The corn poppy belongs in the field alongside other arable weeds and  cultivated grain crops. A single poppy can produce a thousand seeds.  These seeds lay dormant in the ground for decades, made permanent by the plough they churn into the earth dormant until the right conditions. </p>
<p>This continual permanence provides its moniker: <em>corn poppy.</em> The significance of which is lost to chemical weedkillers. Like those  simplistic herbicide advertisements depicting a spray bottle killing a  dandelion till it wilts into <em>nothing,</em> herbicides also kill association. Religated from field to leftover spaces, its contemporary moniker is now the <em>common</em> poppy.  </p>
<p>The construction of the new housing estate - the removal of the  agricultural topsoil and further levelling of the earth has created an  abundance of poppies. Their dormant resilience to human disruption,  construction or destruction, is their significant defining  characteristic besides their colour.</p>
<p>There probably isn't a weed  more appropriated in terms of imagery than the poppy. Early  civilisations associated them with blood, a semiotic foundation  underpinning today's cultural interpretation. Meanwhile, I wonder how  many dormant poppy seeds lay in wait underneath my garden topsoil as the remnants of historic agriculture.</p>

</figure>
<p>Goat willow, which I assumed to be a simple tree, is, in fact, several hybridized variations between goat <em>(salix caprea)</em> and grey <em>(</em>s<em>alix cinerea)</em> willow -amongst others. I often encounter it within overlooked spaces, and  like many plants associated with weeds, I dismissed it as commonplace.  You can often find it as a deciduous shrub or modest scruffy tree  growing in a sheltered and damp space. </p>
<p>I have a female hybrid  willow in my garden. As tall as the house and leaning into the lawn, I  often contemplate cutting it down. The times I've almost fallen out of  it when attempting to prune its limbs extending over the neighbours  fencing. </p>
<p>On occasion, I've whittled spoons out of off-cuts. The  prepared wood is bone white, saturated with water and easy to work with  when wiped with a cloth. The worked wood gradually turns off white with  cooking and eating, obtaining a coffee-coloured patina. It's a practical softwood suitable for coppicing, fast-growing as a living hedge, and  lauded by insect pollinators in spring. For all its benefits, I still  associate it with wasteland.</p>
<p>Despite there being 400+ species under the willow/<em>Salix</em> genus, the word <em>willow</em> brings to mind the ornamental weeping willow. As a cultivated tree, it is  found in urban parks and estate grounds. Its long branches drape over  lawns, paths and waterways. This familiar landscape feature is a  naturalised Chinese species, introduced into Britain and hybridized with the native white willow. </p>
<p>Before the cultural disregard, the goat willow once held religious associations for use on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4DMBrvtf4BC68BjG1ql3Y4H/12-british-wild-plants-that-tell-the-easter-story">Palm Sunday</a>. Its male trees, which produce attractive yellow catkins, were sought  after as an alternative to palms used in processions. This tradition is  redundant becoming frowned upon by early modern Britain. This book of  the Kew series of Natural History from the 1950s uses negative  connotations to describe the practice: <em>hordes of trippers, ramblers and gypsies.</em></p>

<p>The fostered weeping willow is coveted while the native goat/grey willow is neglected within cultural memory. Its religious appropriation is  retired, while it also lacks horticultural ornamental fancy and a  monetary value as lumber. Symbolic then that it now resides within  informal wildlife-focused gardens, nature reserves and leftover spaces.</p>
<p>From an environmental perspective, both goat and grey willow are undervalued native species that provide an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2015/apr/03/goat-willow-start-your-own-bee-orchestra">early food source for early pollinators</a> in turn contributing a habitat for foraging birds. Fortunate then there is a female goat willow on my patch of edgelands located by a road  drainage ditch. Like the willow in my garden, it could be a hybrid but  it resembles the darker hairy branches of the goat willow. </p>
<p>This  specimen is weed-like with a crowded crown of stems vying for space with the dominant hawthorn and blackthorn. Though well established the  willow is singular, with no others in the area. Deer and rabbit are  partial to willow saplings, both of which are in the area and could  damage exposed willow saplings.</p>

<p>Traditionally it is used as a herb for fish. While contemporary foraging guides designate it as a raw salad leaf.

<p>As a weed: Jack-by-the-hedge thrives in the sheltered margins of hedgerows. Urban environments can provide the same, if not similar, shelter. Consequently, like the weeds discussed in last weeks <a href="https://roadsidepicnic.substack.com/p/issue015-of-nettles-and-borage">issue 015</a>, it has an invasive characteristic and is found on brownfield wastelands and car parks.  </p>

        </a>

        <p>The surreal mundane familiarity of the roadside layby ends with a stride into the adjacent woodland. Among last year's leaf fall, the floor is populated by wild garlic. Their pungent leaves, elongated and pointing to the forest floor, paint the spring woodland in a fresh green. Its Latin designation, Allium uranium, ursus referring to bears attributing to its other name <em>bear garlic</em>, suggests that brown bears would enjoy this place. With none in sight, we collect some, using them throughout the week for pesto, cheese scones, and lasagne. It differs from conventional garlic, I find that it has a warm chive taste. Given its uncultivated and brief availability, it signifies spring. </p>
