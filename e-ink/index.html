    <h1>E-ink</h1>
    
    
    <h2>termux-camera-to-kindle.sh</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.bjp-online.com/2018/05/cairnstateshape/">Antony Cairns</a>. This short script was a tiny side project during my COVID restricted masters in photography. With no access to a darkroom I experimented with obscure/misunderstood digital technologies for image-making.</p>
<p>The aim is to demonstrate e-ink technology as a medium for reproduction and the act of repurposing a commercial artefact for unconventional means (in this case appropriating monochrome images -the more indeterminate and abstract the better).</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/kindle.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Originally a python script that called system commands, I rewote the script in bash for less dependencies.</p>
<p>The script can be found here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/rjcalow/termux-camera-to-kindle/-/blob/master/termux-camera-to-kindle.sh">Gitlab</a></p>
<p>Besides the novelty of the process, it allowed me to understand how reproduction works on the e-ink screen, its behaviour and limitations. I found that having a strong contrast applied to images worked best, this may be down to the e-ink screen being limited to 3bit Greyscale (8 shades) -some of the lighter shades of grey lack clarity and are lost to the grey screen.</p>
<h2>Kindle ereader as a means of image reproduction</h2>
<p>To reproduce images on the Kindle, I purposefully chose vague and abstract subject matter playing with the metaphor of culture appropriating nature. These are scans of the Kindle and image.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>This started as a unconventional experiment during the pandemic quarantine, one that approaches [[<a href="../%5Bnature-culture/">nature culture</a>]] theme from a different approach. The more I reflect on it, the less unreasonable it becomes. The act of repurposing cultural artefact for another purpose is a subversive act, mimicking an aspect of the core theme. Additionally it offers discourse on cultural/digital appropriation of nature.</p>
