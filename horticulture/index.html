            <p>Sometimes referred to as heritage kale, cottager's kale and collard trees. Perennial kale varieties are obscure in origin and difficult to obtain as they are propagated by cuttings. They are increasingly popular under permaculture practices.</p>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<h4>Taunton Deane kale</h4>
<p>West Country, UK, origins.</p>
<p>Popular in the UK.</p>
<p>Rarely flowers to produce seeds and propagated via stem cuttings from abundant side shoots.</p>
<p>~~Currently I have three cuttings under lights ready for 2022. The cuttings came from a farm in Doncaster through ebay. ~~</p>

</ul>
<h4>Cottagers kale</h4>
<p>Is this the same as Taunton Deane kale? Similar purple stems. </p>
<p>Various independent seed companies offer the variety as seed, most of which state it is a kale / brussel sprout cross further crossed with a purple sprouting broccoli. </p>
<p>The fact that the variety is offered as seed suggests that, though similar, it is not Taunton Deane.</p>
<p>A young cottagers kale. Note the purple stems.</p>

<h4>Daubenton kale</h4>
<p>Originating from France, it is named after French naturalist Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton. </p>
<p>Has variations. One of which is variegated (marks and patches of different colours).</p>

</ul>
<h4>Nine star</h4>
<p>Broccoli-cauliflower but often grouped into perennial kale. Produces broccoli heads.</p>
<p>Popular. It has a mention in <em>the Vegetable Expert</em> gardening series-</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>STAR PERENNIAL</strong>-plant it against a fence and fork in a general-purpose fertilizer each spring. Apply a mulch in early summer, never let the flower buds open and you will obtain heads year after year. (Hessayon, 1985)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Couve Galega</h4>
<p>A tall Portuguese kale. </p>
<p>Used to make Portuguese <em>caldo verde</em> soup.</p>
<p>Resistant to cold. ONLY a perennial in cold climates. I'm doubtful this would include the UK, what with its hot summers. Does not produce side shoots. Some of the plants went into seed on the first year in spring.</p>

<h4>Seakale</h4>
<p>[[Seakale]] grows along European shorelines. I have seen it on beaches, but never paid it any attention. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This perennial plant may not look like a member of the mustard family, but that is what it is. It is native to light, sandy coastal soils, where it was once cultivated as a crop. It needs feeding, but is otherwise unde manding, and can be planted under glass from February or outdoors from April onwards. It can be propagated by dividing the rootstock. When planted out into its final position, seakale needs about as much space as a large cabbage. Pick the young shoots in spring, having first blanched them under a bucket or similar container. This improves the flavour and enables the vegetable to be cooked or used as a salad. Seakale makes a highly ornamental plant for the vegetable garden when it flowers in May. (Sulzberger, 1994)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seed is difficult to germinate. I was only successful by sowing in sand and leaving outside in winter. I bought plants from <strong><a href="https://www.victoriananursery.co.uk/Seakale-Plants/">victorian nursery</a></strong>.</p>

<h4>Keeper</h4>
<h5>Daubenton x purple tree collard cross</h5>
<p>Bred by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/182244131939228/search/?q=Graham%20D%20Jenkins">Graham Jenkins-Belohorska</a>. </p>
<p>Little information online. Have to deep dive. But, can be found on ebay. </p>
<p>Descriptions often cite its bushy appearance. </p>

            <p>Hydrangeas can be used a natural litmus test using their colour shifts based on the soil pH.</p>
<p>The more acidic the soil (lower the pH) the more blue the flowers are. Likewise, the more alkaline (higher the pH) the soil the more pink. </p>
<p>My hydrangea flowers sit between purple and pink.</p>

            <p>A log of notes and images documenting my efforts to perennialize my vegpatch by introducing Seakale for 2022.</p>
<h4>Attempt at germination</h4>
<p>29/7/2021</p>
<p>The start. I receive seeds, they go straight into pots and under grow lights where they will live till next spring. Sceptical, I wait for germination. From what I gather they are difficult to germinate. </p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../imgs/IMG_20210729_120144.jpg" /><figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>7/9/2021</p>
<p>All the seeds failed to germinate. Some time in late August I restart-rethink. I try two methods: (1) soaking seeds in salt water for 24hours, and (2) sowing seeds in sand and leaving them outside under the porch. </p>
<p>The second method results in one successful germination. This is repotted in compost/sand, brought inside and placed under lights. The seeds need a period of cold stratification? </p>

</figure>
<p>22/9/2021</p>
<p>The seakale seedling has developed a leaf. It lives in a ikea <em>socker</em> greenhouse. I use a spray to keep the humidity up. </p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../imgs/IMG_20210922_164026-16325219135784.jpg" /><figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>2/2/2022</p>
<p>Currently it lives in the garden greenhouse. It hated the house. Constantly grew large leafs then wilted. Too humid? Hopefully it will pick up.</p>
<p>2/8/2022</p>
<p>The surviving seedling never took. Even outside. It repeated spurts of growth then wilted. I caved and bought plants from <strong><a href="https://www.victoriananursery.co.uk/Seakale-Plants/">victorian nursery</a></strong>.</p>
