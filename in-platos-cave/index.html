    <pre><code>These notes were written during my degree - I cannot vouch for their accurateness.

<blockquote>
<p>An essay about the nature and act of photography itself. Sontag argues that a photograph is an object often with a longer life span than the subject, and also that the photographic act is an observable non-intervention form but still a participating social event. Here are some quotes which interested me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Photographs alter and enlarge our notions of what is worth looking at and what we have a right to observe, page 3</p>
<p>To collect photographs is to collect the world, page 3</p>
<p><strong>Photographs really are experience captured and the camera is the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood, page 3</strong></p>
<p>To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed, page 4</p>
<p>Photographed images do not seem to be statements about the world so much as pieces of it, page 4</p>
<p>Photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored, tricked out. They age, plagued by the usual ills of paper objects; they disappear; they become valuable, and get bought and sold; they are reproduced, page 4</p>
<p>photos are fragile objects, page 4</p>
<p>a photograph loses much less of its essential quality when reproduced in a book than a painting does, page 5</p>
<p>Photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about, but doubt, seems proven when we’re shown a photograph of it, page 5</p>
<p><strong>A photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened. The picture may distort; but there is always a presumption that something exists, or did exist, which is like what’s in the picture. Whatever the limitations (through amateurism) or pretensions (through artistry) of the individual photographer, a photograph — any photograph — seems to have a more innocent, and therefore more accurate, relation to visible reality than do other mimetic objects,</strong> page 5</p>
<p>Virtuosi of the noble image like Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand, composing mighty, unforgettable photographs decade after decade, still want, first of all, to show something out there, just like the Polaroid owner for whom photographs are a handy, fast form of note-taking, or the shutterbug with a Brownie who takes snapshots as souvenirs of daily life, page 6</p>
<p>Even when photographers are most concerned with mirroring reality, they are still haunted by tacit imperatives of taste and conscience, page 6 – Sontag refers to the FSA photographers who looked to get the right look on film</p>
<p>In deciding how a picture should look, in preferring one exposure to another, photographers are always imposing standards on their subjects. Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are, pages 6-7 – Sontag’s ideas on the photographer imposing a look and interpreting a reality</p>
<p>The subsequent industrialization of camera technology only carried out a promise inherent in photography from its very beginning: to democratize all experiences by translating them into images, page 7 - rise of Kodak and the brownie</p>
<p>Images which idealize (like most fashion and animal photography) are no less aggressive than work which makes a virtue of plainness (like class pictures, still lifes of the bleaker sort, and mug shots). There is an aggression implicit in every use of the camera. page 7 – Sontag on idealisation and referring to the photographic message as aggression.</p>
<p>The subsequent industrialization of camera technology only carried out a promise inherent in photography from its very beginning: to democratize all experiences by translating them into images, page 7 Sontag then goes on to talk about early photography implying it was gratuitous and for the rich with no social use but simply an artistic activity.</p>
<p>It was only with its industrialization that photography came into its own as art. As industrialization provided social uses for the operations of the photographer, so the reaction against these uses reinforced the self-consciousness of photography-as-art, page 8</p>
<p>…like every mass art form, photography is not practiced by most people as an art. It is mainly a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power, page 8</p>
<p>It seems positively unnatural to travel for pleasure without taking a camera along. Photographs will offer indisputable evidence that the trip was made, that the program was carried out, that fun was had. Photographs document sequences of consumption carried on outside the view of family, friends, neighbours, page 9 Evidence</p>
<p>Photography has become one of the principal devices for experiencing something, for giving an appearance of participation, page 10</p>
<p>Taking photographs has set up a chronic voyeuristic relation to the world which levels the meaning of all events, page 11</p>
<p>A photograph is not just the result of an encounter between an event and a photographer; picture-taking is an event in itself, and one with ever more peremptory rights– to interfere with, to invade, or to ignore whatever is going on page 11, the photographic act is a social event</p>
<p>After the event has ended, the picture will still exist, conferring on the event a kind of immortality (and impor-tance) it would never otherwise have enjoyed. While real people are out there killing themselves or other real people, the photographer stays behind his or her camera, creating a tiny element of another world: the image-world that bids to outlast us all,  page 11, sontag on worth and the life span of a photograph as well as the reality captured.</p>
<p>Photographing is essentially an act of non-intervention. page 11</p>
<p>…the photographer has the choice between a photo-graph and a life, to choose the photograph. The person who intervenes cannot record; the person who is recording can-not intervene.  page 12</p>
<p>Even if incompatible with intervention in a physical sense, using a camera is still a form of participation. Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing. page 12</p>
<p>To take a picture is to have an interest in things as they are page 12</p>
<p>Like a car, a camera is sold as a predatory weapon–one that’s as automated as possible, ready to spring. Popular taste expects an easy, an invisible technology. Manufacturers reas-sure their customers that taking pictures demands no skill or expert knowledge, that the machine is all-knowing, and responds to the slightest pressure of the will. It’s as simple as turning the ignition key or pulling the trigger.  page 14. Sontag on photographic technology- kind of echos apples iphone adverts demonstrating how easy the camera is.</p>
<p>To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never see themselves, by having knowledge of them they can never have; it turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed.  page 14. This statement on morals applies to portraits and street photography. ‘objects’ is in relation to the photograph.</p>
<p>An ugly or grotesque subject may be moving because it has been dignified by the attention of the photographer. A beautiful subject can be the object of rueful feelings, because it has aged or decayed or no longer exists. page 15, This could relate to documentary photography</p>
<p>All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another person’s (or thing’s) mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt. page 15. Here Sontag discuses photography in relation to time. Memento mori is a Latin phrase meaning ‘remember you must die’.</p>
<p>…photographs express a feeling both sentimental and implicitly magical: they are at-tempts to contact or lay claim to another reality.  page 16</p>
<p>Photographs cannot create a moral position, but they can reinforce one–and can help build a nascent one.  page 17</p>
<p>Photographs may be more memorable than moving images, because they are a neat slice of time, not a flow. Television is a stream of underselected images, each of which cancels its predecessor. Each still photograph is a privileged moment, turned into a slim object that one can keep and look at again. page 17 – 18, sontag on still vs moving image</p>
<p>The quality of feeling, including moral outrage, that people can muster in response to photographs of the oppressed, the exploited, the starving, and the massacred also depends on the degree of their familiarity with these images. page 19, Sontag asserts that context and prior knowledge is required to understand photos of suffering and make moral judgements. Then goes on to talk about Don McCullin.</p>
<p>Photographs shock insofar as they show something novel. Unfortunately, the ante keeps getting raised — partly through the very proliferation of such images of horror page 19. This is seen in the gradual sexualazation of fashion photography from the 60s to 90s.</p>
<p>Once one has seen such images, one has started down the road of seeing more — and more. Images transfix. Images anesthetize. An event known through photographs certainly becomes more real than it would have been if one had never seen</p>
<p>the photographs page 20, this relates to the previous quote, we become use to shocking images over time.</p>
<p>The same law holds for evil as for pornography. The shock of photographed atrocities wears off with repeated viewings, just as the surprise and bemusement felt the first time one sees a pornographic movie wear off after one sees a few more. page 20</p>
<p>Time eventually positions most photographs, even the most amateurish, at the level of art. page 21. Like Eugène Atget or more recently Vivian Maier’s work.</p>
<p>Photographs are valued because they give information. They tell one what there is; they make an inventory. page 22. Sontag’s thoughts on value and information.</p>
<p>The information that photographs can give starts to seem very important at that moment in cultural history when everyone is thought to have a right to something called news. Photographs were seen as a way of giving information to people who do not take easily to reading. page 22, Sontag sees photographs as a way to communicate information quickly and easily, hence photojournalism</p>
<p>The photograph is a thin slice of space as well as time. page 22.  A captured reality.</p>
<p>In a world ruled by photographic images, all borders (framing) seem arbitrary. Anything can be separated, can be made discontinuous, from anything else: all that is necessary is to frame the subject differently. page 22, a photograph is an image composed within a frame. By moving the frame, can the photographer change perception and alter the message.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, one never understands anything from a photograph. Of course, photographs fill in blanks in our mental pictures of the present and the past page 23. Sontag then uses Jacob Riis as an example.</p>
<p>Needing to have reality confirmed and experience enhanced by photographs is an aesthetic consumerism to which everyone is now addicted, page 24, this is more true than ever with instagram and social media. Take the food photography trend, whereby instagram users photograph their meals before eating.</p>
