    <h1>Estovers</h1>
    
    
    <p>Hello <em><a href="https://roadsidepicnic.substack.com/">Roadside Picnic</a></em> subscribers. This week’s letter comprises notes from sketchbook curating. </p>
<p><a href="../imgs/b4cb1042-29a8-4afb-b580-d9065359a37b_1333x2000.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/b4cb1042-29a8-4afb-b580-d9065359a37b_1333x2000.jpeg" /></a>A rare occurrence of the sun</p>
<p>This week: the weather has made even a leisurely walk to the golf course gruelling. Being inside more than usual, I have reflected on current work- images made through covid walks permitted under the government guideline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>exercise with your household (or support bubble) or one other person, this should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210104200338/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">gov.uk</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m interested in the idea of the <em>allowance</em> to a resource or access outdoors. Prepandemic, an archaic example is the <em><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-common-land#public-access-rights">rights of common</a>.</em>A set of antiquated named rights for common land such as <em>Animals ferae naturae -</em>the right to take wild animals, <em>Piscary -</em>the right to fish, <em>Pannage</em>-the right to put pigs out to feed and <em>Pasturage -</em>the right to put livestock out to feed. The last is one is probably the only one I have encountered in person, observed in the peak district where sheep graze heathered commons. </p>
<p>Of the rights of the common, <em>Estovers</em>is the most interesting. It is the right to the wood on a common. This might be whole trees or <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/little-dartmouth/features/what-is-woodland-coppicing">coppicing</a> for firewood. The word <em>Estovers</em>derives from old french <em>estovoir</em>-to be necessary<em>,</em>and Latin <em>est opus</em>-there is need (<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/estovers">collins</a>). The etymology emphases appropriating land as a necessity.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing <em>Estovers</em>, I arranged images, first digitally and then in my sketchbook. Organizing digitally is challenging as it is difficult for a screen to replace physical prints spread out on a table or a wall like <a href="https://www.featureshoot.com/2014/12/a-look-inside-photographers-sketchbooks/">Alec Soth in photographers sketchbooks</a>. But it is cheaper and immediate as a starting process. I found a program called <a href="https://www.pureref.com/">PureRef</a> which allows you to throw in images and arrange them at will. It's not perfect, but it is freeing.  </p>
<p><a href="../imgs/a19867cf-c65c-454b-bd7a-a280099bed0e_2908x3000.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/a19867cf-c65c-454b-bd7a-a280099bed0e_2908x3000.jpeg" /></a>I persuaded my inkjet printer to print some of the images I liked. The ones it messed up I kept anyway. For walking in my allotted one per day exercise, I rearranged my sketchbook into a transitional narrative through banal urban, to interstitial liminal spaces, to more recognizably rural spaces. Though not taking wood, I am appropriating these spaces for my mediated view of the camera through a framework of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/anthropocene/">Anthropocene</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/29/protecting-nature-vital-pandemics-report-outbreaks-wild">death of nature</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../imgs/9a5ac841-a03b-4a0a-a494-9d71737cc583_1200x800.gif"><img alt="" src="../imgs/9a5ac841-a03b-4a0a-a494-9d71737cc583_1200x800.gif" /></a>I don't think the sequence is perfect. It doesn't need to be. With it being in a sketchbook, it can be remixed, ripped, and torn into something else.</p>
