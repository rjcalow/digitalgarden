    <h1>Retail decline & Spring equinox</h1>
    
    
    <p>Hello <em><a href="https://roadsidepicnic.substack.com/">Roadside Picnic</a></em> subscribers. This week’s letter comprises field notes from an urban walk, the future of the British highstreet and a series of photos from a walk on yesterday’s spring equinox. </p>
<p><a href="../imgs/3df3f687-56c4-47a8-bb5a-9cb47ab84d6d_1333x2000.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/3df3f687-56c4-47a8-bb5a-9cb47ab84d6d_1333x2000.jpeg" /></a>This blossoming cherry-plum tree in a suburban void is like a little bit of Japan.</p>
<p>Walking: departing the familiar edgelands and the monotonous suburbs, we head for the town centre to run an errand. I don't stay long. I never do. Rather than acknowledging the empty high street disrupted by bakeries and discount stores, I am more interested in a discarded mattress propped up against the back of the old co-op. The scene is an urban photographers trope, but also an indication that the space is overlooked and unwatched. There is an inkling of nostalgia and consideration too, with the Edwardian terrace unscathed while the 1980’s retail architecture is momentarily used to prop up the abandoned piss stained mattress.</p>
<p><a href="../imgs/0fa3725e-3a15-49b8-8ea8-3f871a128b48_2000x1333.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/0fa3725e-3a15-49b8-8ea8-3f871a128b48_2000x1333.jpeg" /></a>The nostalgia is continued by a trail of discarded floppy discs along a road. Some have blue biro written labels like "Docs 16". It becomes a game finding the next one.</p>
<p><a href="../imgs/469d8a5e-5262-491b-b20a-f0d177a39809_3000x2572.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/469d8a5e-5262-491b-b20a-f0d177a39809_3000x2572.jpeg" /></a>The trail of obsolete artefacts ends at a closed down off-licence. Situated on a corner, the building has a mundane brutalist practicality with its rectangular shape and bricked-up windows forming an assortment of red-brick textures and patterns. At its rear is a set of faded pink loading bay doors below a brutalist set of right angles.</p>
<p><a href="../imgs/c27d6589-b71e-4e30-96d0-48f15bbcd606_2000x2000.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/c27d6589-b71e-4e30-96d0-48f15bbcd606_2000x2000.jpeg" /></a>The perimeter of the building is a modest urban wildscape of thick grasses, nettles, and Apiaceae (I need to work on identifying the difference between wild parsnip, wild carrot and hemlock). The blue storefront cladding is scarred by ivy, which now continues to reclaim the walls and given the chance it will devour the unused building.</p>
<p><a href="../imgs/31ad925e-30b3-4bbf-9955-c2bcede59e8f_2000x1333.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/31ad925e-30b3-4bbf-9955-c2bcede59e8f_2000x1333.jpeg" /></a>This shutdown store is part of the greater changing urban landscape, often summarised in the British press as the demise of the high street with hesitant councils, landlords and urban planners disregarding the reality of changing retail habits. A 2019 parliamentary report on the future of high streets and town centres states-</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcomloc/1010/full-report.html#heading-7">"retail is not the main anchor any more for the 21st century, and it needs to be replaced with other activities"</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report goes on to suggest high streets and town centres, to survive, should focus on social, leisure and entertainment-based activities rather than financial ones. The next ten years could be an exciting time of redevelopment and transformation of outmoded and unused retail areas. The alternative is that authorities carry on and ignore changing consumer habits. In doing so they could drive high streets and town centres into unproductive empty dereliction. The type of spaces where people discard mattresses and floppy discs. Either way, there is going to be interesting work from urban landscape and social documentary photographers in the coming future.</p>
<p>An example of failure I have been following is Nottingham's Broadmarsh shopping centre.</p>
<p><a href="../imgs/7aba39e6-0e21-4c96-aa41-df70d94be58a_732x976.jpeg"><img alt="" src="../imgs/7aba39e6-0e21-4c96-aa41-df70d94be58a_732x976.jpeg" /></a>Broadmarsh Jan-2020</p>
<p>Constructed in the early 1970s, it was situated as a gateway between public transport links and the greater city. Last year it was part of my commute to uni. Redevelopment of the centre was underway. The dim walls, plastered with false promises of a retail utopia, shook and vibrated with construction work. While the wet floors and alternating pedestrian route through the site made for a grim obstacle course. It was not the safest route, but the only route if I wanted to be on time.</p>
<p>With Covid, the uni postponed in-person teaching, ending my commute and my visits to the site. At the same time the owners of the centre went into administration forcing redevelopment to stop. Currently, demolition is <a href="https://westbridgfordwire.com/plans-to-demolish-the-remaining-broadmarsh-centre/">scheduled for April 2022</a>, with the council investigating the future of the site. Many of the proposed redevelopments are open spaces including <a href="https://www.nottinghamshirewildlife.org/broadmarsh-reimagined">Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust proposed greenspace</a>.  </p>

<p>Though I enjoy documenting ambivalent urban spaces, a morning walk through a park, formal or wild, as a part of a commute would be more engaging than a walk through an obsolete retail-focused <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100237780">non-place</a>.  </p>
