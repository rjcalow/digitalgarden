            <p>Through the lack of context and their subversive <em>edgy</em> characteristics, edgeland sites can harbour suspicion. These are out of town areas where the socially marginal meet for questionable or immoral activities.  These dystopias are enforced and exploited through film and tv.  Throughout the 1990's the backdrop of the indie crime movie was an  edgeland site. The place where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLyajC5-gFs">money is exchanged</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaco4Ea5nXY">money is stolen</a>, and the criminal-protagonist cover is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rdS5O7vo">walking the dog</a>. Of course, the edginess is hyperbole, visually enhanced with banal  industrial architecture, debris and monotonous colour balances. Film  portrays them as landscapes where concluding conflict is played out. In  reality, these areas, besides the occasional glimpses of marginal  society (the attempted dog theft) spurring suspicion, are not  straightforward dystopias but banal urban peripheries with complex  social processes. </p>
<p>Author of the term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aura of excitement which goes with the apparent lawlessness of the edgelands has been exploited in such films of the 1990s as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Things to Do in Denver When you’re Dead, Fargo and The Straight Story. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Roberts, M. S.]] co-author of edgelands <em>Journeys Into England's True Wilderness</em> (2011):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marion Shoard’s coining of ‘edgelands’ seemed to conjure exactly our experience of these places. They were, and are, edgy. In British tv drama and low budget films, the edgelands are always the place of the dénouement, the place where the drug gang is busted, the car chase ends, or the kidnap victim is rescued. These are places where anything could happen. And when it did, it was usually illegal or contravened every rule of health and safety. This sense of the edgelands as a dystopian landscape is a familiar trope of British popular culture in particular. (Roberts, 2016, pp. 19–20)</p>

            <p>Empty, unoccupied or peripheral urban spaces.  </p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Naming turns space into place (Wells, 2011, p. 3).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[[Edgelands]] - indeterminate interfacial between urban and rural. </li>
<li>[[Urban Wildscape]] - urban spaces under the agency of nature.</li>
<li>[[Third landscape]] - spaces left to natural evolution.</li>
<li>[[Non-place]]  - contemporary urban spaces without history.</li>
<li>[[Terrain vague]]  - imprecise spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Avoiding the predetermined</h3>
<p>As a " " landscape photographer " " I constantly need reminding, that despite the above definitions, landscape is a <mark>“highly differentiated discourse on representing space”</mark> (Bate, 2009, p. 93).</p>
<p>Following a unique interpretation of a site whether that is through geography, autobiography, or metaphor, will create original work and avoid cliche.   </p>

              >
            </h1>

            <p>French landscape theoretical term for indeterminate space, defined by Spanish architect, Ignasi de Solà- Morales, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to capture in a single English word or phrase the meaning of terrain vague. The French term terrain connotes a more urban quality than the English land; thus terrain is an extension of the precisely limited ground fit for construction, for the city.” (de Solà- Morales, 2013, p. 26).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Breaking down the etymology</h3>
<ul>
<li>The term has duality stemming from Latin: “Vague descends from vacuus, giving us “vacant” and “vacuum” in English, which is to say “empty, unoccupied,” yet also “free, available, unengaged.”  </li>
<li>A second meaning superimposed on the French vague derives from the Latin vagus, giving “vague” in English, too, in the sense of <mark>“indeterminate, imprecise, blurred, uncertain.”</mark> (de Solà- Morales, 2013, p. 26). </li>
<li>Solà- Morales uses the french term ‘terrain vague’ because the English vocabulary for these pockets of vacant landscape have negative connotations such as wasteland.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My favourite explanation</h3>
<p>Stanka Radović has a clear definition in the essay ‘on the threshold’ - an essay using the Andrei Tarkovsky 1979 film, Stalker, to explore the term as a utopia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“... terrain vague escapes and challenges rigid definitions. Is it urban or is it natural? Is it a concept or a concrete place? Free or forlorn? The term “terrain vague” translates into English as “wasteland,” “derelict area,” or “vacant land,” and refers to abandoned or unoccupied portions of urban land that remain available for spontaneous use.” (Radović, 2013, p. 114)</p>

            <h3>( Tiers-Paysage )</h3>
<p>A term for <em>les délaissés</em> (leftover spaces of urban development) for nature to colonise. Coined by Gilles Clément, a French garden designer, botanist, entomologist and writer, in a manifesto entitled ‘Manifeste du Tiers paysage’.</p>
<p>In ‘Manifeste du Tiers paysage’, Clément argues that neglected and unexploited space is a reserve under the term third landscape. Left to evolution, biological processes and agency transform anthropized territories to natural spaces which provide biodiverse habitats for fauna and flora but can also be used by society as spaces for leisure and connection to the natural world.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the indeterminate urban boundary between rural territories which can host infrastructure, golf courses, car parks and canals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>marginal areas outside of conventional urban circuits like derelict and brownfield sites.</p>

            <p>Woodland findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The area of woodland in the UK at 31 March 2019 is estimated to be 3.19 million hectares. This represents 13% of the total land area in the UK, 10% in England, 15% in Wales, 19% in Scotland and 8% in Northern Ireland.</li>
<li>Of the total UK woodland area, 0.86 million hectares (27%) is owned or managed by Forestry England, Forestry and Land Scotland, Natural Resources Wales or the Forest Service (in Northern Ireland).</li>
<li>The total certified woodland area in the UK at 31 March 2019 is 1.40 million hectares, including all Forestry England/Forestry and Land Scotland1/Natural Resources Wales/Forest Service woodland. Overall, 44% of the UK woodland area is certified.</li>
<li>Thirteen thousand hectares of new woodland were created in the UK in 2018-19, with conifers accounting for 60% of this area.</li>
<li>A total of 842 sites were served with a Statutory Plant Health Notice in 2018-19, requiring a total of 3.8 thousand hectares of woodland to be felled. (This excludes areas felled within the Phytophthora ramorum management zone in south west Scotland, where a Statutory Plant Health Notice is not required).</li>
<li>(Forestry Commission, 2019)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rural affairs:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2017/18 there were 545,000 businesses registered in rural areas, accounting for 24 per cent of all registered businesses in England. </li>
<li>Businesses registered in rural areas employed 3.6 million people, accounting for 13 per cent of all those employed by registered businesses in England. </li>
<li>There are more registered businesses per head of population in predominantly rural areas than in predominantly urban areas (excluding London).</li>
<li>There are proportionately more small businesses in rural areas.</li>
<li>In 2017 there were 46 registered business start-ups per 10,000 population in predominantly rural areas compared with 55 per 10,000 population in predominantly urban areas (excluding London).</li>

<p>Further rural affairs:</p>
<p><em>These figures are current until they are replaced on the 19th of December 2019.</em></p>
<p>Second estimate figures for 2018 compared to 2017, in current prices, show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Income from Farming fell by £971 million (17%) to £4,644 million </li>
<li>Agriculture contributed £9,548 million or 0.51% to the national economy (Gross Value Added), a decrease of £651 million (6%) on the year. </li>
</ul>
<p>The main drivers of these changes are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An increase of £538 million (2%) in gross output to £26,562 million </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An increase of £1,189 million (8%) in the value of intermediate consumption to £17,014 million </p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Crop output value rose by 0.9% to £9,265 million. The cold, wet spring followed by the dry, hot summer contributed to lower yields of key crops however better prices helped offset production falls. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The value of total livestock output rose by 2% to £14,741 million. Prices were generally higher but the challenging weather conditions affected volumes; the late cold spring disrupted lambing and the hot, dry summer led to poor grass growth and difficulties feeding livestock.</li>
<li>In general all intermediate consumption costs rose, with fuel, feed and fertiliser costs showing the largest increases. </li>

<p>… the conservation movement, while well intentioned, has sought to freeze living systems in time. It attempts to prevent animals and plants from either leaving or–if they do not live there already–entering. It seeks to manage nature as if tending a garden. Many of the ecosystems, such as heath and moorland, blanket bog and rough grass, that it tries to preserve are dominated by the low, scrubby vegetation which remains after forests have been repeatedly cleared and burnt. <mark> This vegetation is cherished by wildlife groups, which prevent it from reverting to woodland through intensive grazing by sheep, cattle and horses. It is as if conservationists in the Amazon had decided to protect the cattle ranches, rather than the rainforest.  </mark>(Monbiot, 2014, p. 8)</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>E. M. Forster in 1964 wrote that two world wars had enveloped the wildness of Britain. “‘Two great wars demanded and bequeathed regimentation,’ wrote E. M. Forster in 1964, ‘science lent her aid, and the wildness of these islands, never extensive, was stamped upon and built over and patrolled in no time. There is no forest or fell to escape to today, no cave in which to curl up, and no deserted valley.’” (Macfarlane 2009, p.8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Raban claims Britain lost its wilderness much earlier in the 1860s with population and industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so thickly peopled, so intensively farmed, so industrialised, so citified, that there was nowhere to go to be truly alone, or to have … adventures, except to sea. (Jonathan Raban Cited in (Macfarlane 2009, p.8))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Macfarlane states population and the road network is really to blame for the lack of wilderness or remoteness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Britain, over sixty-one million people now live in 93,000 square miles of land. Remoteness has been almost abolished, and the main agents of that abolition have been the car and the road. Only a small and diminishing proportion of terrain is now more than five miles from a motorable surface. There are nearly thirty million cars in use in Britain, and 210,000 miles of road on the mainland alone. (Macfarlane 2009, p.9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>George Monbiot argues that there is a wildness paradox, that Britain's gardens have more wildlife in them than barren uplands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend two hours sitting in a bushy suburban garden anywhere in Britain, and you are likely to see more birds, and of a wider range of species, than you would while walking five miles across almost any open landscape in the uplands. (Monbiot 2014, p.69)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Liz Wells argues Britain is a managed land and notes the paradox of the pictorial countryside as safe, clean, and undisturbed rather than managed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...<strong>British land is managed – there is no wilderness</strong>; even the coastal littoral is overseen (by the Environment Agency). It follows that landscapes and vistas are human constructs, which means that aesthetic principles, as well as social mores, were and are in play within the actual shaping of land. Pictorial renderings of countryside as pastoral depict Britain as undisturbed and undisturbing, thus contributing to constructing a simplified and benign rural imaginary, to picturing countryside as safe. (Wells 2011, p.164)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lack of wild animals like wolves, beaver and boar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So few wild creatures, relatively, remain in Britain and Ireland: so few, relatively, in the world. Pursuing our project of civilisation, we have pushed thousands of species towards the brink of disappearance, and many thousands more over that edge. The loss, after it is theirs, is ours. Wild animals, like wild places, are invaluable to us precisely because they are not us. They are uncompromisingly different. (Macfarlane 2009, p.306,307)</p>
