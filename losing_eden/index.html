    <h2 id="why-our-minds-need-the-wild-by-lucy-jones">Why Our Minds Need the Wild by Lucy Jones</h2>
<p>Contemporary literary work on the British landscape tends to be a focus on nature, wilderness, or wonder. This, however, focuses on the wellbeing and health benefits of nature. Backed by scientific research, it features a substantial scientific and academic bibliography in conjunction with accessible writing.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-chapter">Introduction chapter</h2>
<h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>
<p>Psychoterratic - mental health in relation to the earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychoterratic illnesses, for example, are earth-related mental health issues such as ecoanxiety and global dread.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solastalgia - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151030-have-you-ever-felt-solastalgia">is when your endemic sense of place is being violated</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Solastalgia’ – an admixture of solace, nostalgia and destruction – describes a feeling of nostalgia and powerlessness about a place that once brought solace which has been destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Species loneliness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...to mean a collective sorrow and anxiety arising from our disconnection from other species.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed and agreed with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...it would appear that industrialized society perceives nature to be little more than a nicety: a luxury, an extra, a garnish – ‘Green crap’, as the former prime minister David Cameron reportedly called environmental policies
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="brief-timeline-of-cultures-relationship-with-nature">Brief timeline of cultures relationship with nature</h3>
<p>Arcadia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virgil’s account of Arcadia, from his Eclogues (also known as the Bucolics), was a landscape of comfort and healing – with its cool springs, zephyrs, laurels and tamarisks – for Gallus, who was dying of a broken heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Industrialization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...as the West became industrialized and our contact and connection with the natural world around us dwindled. As people moved to cities, and away from the land, they had to actively seek out nature, as they became physically separated from it. In the pre-industrialized West, the wilderness was often seen as cruel, revolting and ugly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romanization of nature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from the eighteenth century onwards people began to see the natural landscape in a new way, and with the rise of the Romantic movement in art and poetry, and Transcendentalists such as Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a brief timeline, Jones discusses post-industrial attitudes to nature and mental health with Victorian/Edwardian asylums having gardens. Followed by contemporary nature therapy and the authors personal interest. </p>
<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<h3 id="mycobacterium-vaccae">Mycobacterium vaccae:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>hypothesize that an immune response to M. vaccae stimulates the brain to create more serotonin, the happy chemical that antidepressant pills are designed to boost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></ br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our microbiota are healthiest when they are diverse – and a diverse microbiota is influenced positively by an environment filled with organisms, which are found more abundantly in outside spaces than inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones shares Tim Ingold's analogy "...these histories are woven, along with the life-cycles of plants and animals, into the texture of the surface itself (Ingold, 2000, p. 198)."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we are woven into the land, and wider ecosystems, more than we realize</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figures</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies show that just <strong>two hours</strong> in a forest can significantly lower cytokine levels in the blood, soothing inflammation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></ br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In animal studies, T-cells (cells which modulate the immune system) have a surprisingly long half-life of <strong>twenty-seven days</strong>. This suggests that your post-gardening high could keep you buzzing for days, or even weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
