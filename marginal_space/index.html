<p>As a " " landscape photographer " " I constantly need reminding, that despite the above definitions, landscape is a <mark>“highly differentiated discourse on representing space”</mark> (Bate, 2009, p. 93).</p>
<p>Following a unique interpretation of a site whether that is through geography, autobiography, or metaphor, will create original work and avoid cliche.   </p>

      <blockquote><a href="../artist_statement_for_snag__inflorescence/">Artist statement for Snag  Inflorescence</a> <i><p>[[Marginal space]] denotes a territory which exists on an edge or margin of an interface. Often the consequence of abandonment as well as the by-product of urban development and the intermittent economic tide on which it is determined by, these unproductive spaces are situated between others. Due to their segregated interstice nature, they are territories which fall outside of the conventional urban circuit. </p></i></blockquote>
      
      <blockquote><a href="../artist_statement_for_snag__inflorescence/">Artist statement for Snag  Inflorescence</a> <i><p>In its intended form, the photobook, the sequenced images invite the viewer to question the space: its past through its evident horticultural legacy and its future as post-garden feral abandonment takes hold. The work is subjective with both sides of the narrative presented within the border construct, leaving the viewer to question the ambivalent scenes against their own spatial presumptions. Furthermore, by not adopting a relevant spatial connotation such as “[[urban wildscape]]” or “derelict land”, the work uses the inexact and transitional characteristic of [[marginal space]] as a narrative device, allowing the space to be open to interpretation. This conceptual play of imprecise spatial connotation and acknowledgement that humans live through the landscapes they inhabit, demonstrates a unique [[nature culture]] relationship: a transitional border between the garden and a new wilder space where the existing cultivated nature grows uncontrolled alongside opportunistic self-seeding nature.</p></i></blockquote>
