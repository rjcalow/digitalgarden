<blockquote>
<p>In 1967 art student Richard Long caught a train from Waterloo to an unknown destination in Surrey. He ended up in a field of grass where he 'drew' a line by walking backwards and forwards repeatedly. A black and white snapshot recorded the event and has since been endlessly reproduced in diverse art publications around the world. Indeed, A Line Made by Walking is now the subject of an entire book by critic and curator Dieter Roelstraete, published by Afterall Books, London, in 2010. Deliberately. Roelstraerte meanders as he attempts to scrutinise a straight line. Some obvious contexts, such as early Conceptual Art, Land Art and Performance Art are all dealt with briskly. But he is particularly inspiring when a digression relates Long's work to the less obvious context of slapstick. Slapstick is generally defined as knockabout humour. However, Roelstraerte more specifically pinpoints a deadpan dumbness in Long's 'drawing' that he associates with Samuel Beckett and a comic actor greatly admired by Beckett, namely Buster Keaton.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL FOR DAVID EVANS FOR THE BOOK THE ART OF WALKING: A FIELD GUIDE. BLACK DOG PUBLISHING, 10a ACTON STREET, LONDON, WC1X 9NG, UNITED KINGDOM. June 2012.</p>
<p>I propose to walk exactly one kilometre whilst carrying my 35mm film camera. The one kilometer walk would start when the first photograph is taken, then every 27.77 steps I will stop, place the camera up to my left eye and take a single photograph of whatever is in front of me at that exact point.
The walk would be regulated by my own locomotion and gait, and also recorded by 36 photographs of the journey from start to finish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zone is the story of a city at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It is also the story of a city marked by a film. New rules were changing the old ways forever. The city had seen many changes. The pictures are the story of a city (Tallinn) haunted by the image of a film. The film ([[Stalker]]) tells the story of a writer and a scientist who go into an alien zone, where it is said a room exists in which your deepest desire will be granted. After the aliens had left many still feared this zone and its strange logic that few knew or understood. The zone could turn against you; it altered when someone moved through it, and so people found it hard to orient themselves within it. A guide was needed, the stalker, who volunteered to take the writer and scientist into the zone.</p>
