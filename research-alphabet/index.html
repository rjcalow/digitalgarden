    <h1>Research Alphabet</h1>
    
    
    <p><em>The following is an example research alphabet I used for the beginning of a project.</em></p>
<h2>Photographic Alphabet 29/9/2019</h2>
<h3>A:</h3>
<h3>Alternative processes</h3>
<p>Possible historic and modern processes to look at:</p>
<h4>Albumen print</h4>
<p>A historic process involving silver nitrates bound with proteins found in egg whites. Prints are sepia in tone with broad contrasts (considering it was invented in 1850). See Argyrotype for a more modern sepia toned contact printing process. Also see Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques page 162 for a recipe. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.162)</p>
<h4>Argyrotype</h4>
<p>A modern take on the Van Dyke and Argentotype process. Developed by photographer Mike Ware as a less expensive and less toxic method of creating alternative contact prints, the process involves both iron and silver. The produced print is similar to a Van Dyke or sepia-toned cyanotype. The inventers website has an article on the process at <a href="https://www.mikeware.co.uk/mikeware/Argyrotype%5C_Process.html">https://www.mikeware.co.uk/mikeware/Argyrotype\_Process.html</a>. Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques page 152 has a recipe and instruction. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.152)</p>
<h4>Caffenol</h4>
<p>Alternative chemistry involving a coffee-based solution, mixed with sodium carbonate and ascorbic acid) for developing film and photographic paper. Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques page 130 describes the process and recipe. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.130)</p>
<h4>Collodion</h4>
<p>A historic photographic process involving chemical-intensive methodology by mixing soluble iodide with cellulose nitrate, and coating the mixture on to glass. This wet plate can then be loaded in camera and exposed. The immediate developing process involves pyrogallic acid, followed by a pouring of sodium thiosulphate.</p>
<p>Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques features several hacks for using wet plates in polaroid and 35mm cameras on pages 120 onwards. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.120)</p>
<h4>Cyanotype</h4>
<p>A historical process creating blue coloured contact prints, historically used as cheaply reproduced engineering blueprints. The chemical methodology relies on the light sensitivity of iron salts. Paper or other material is sensitized by coating a cyanotype solution on to the surface and exposed using UV lights or the sun.</p>
<p>Digital negatives via tracing paper can be used or object such as plants. Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques pages 136 onwards features a recipe and instructions. .(Antonini et al. 2015, p.136)</p>
<h4>Gum Bichromate</h4>
<p>Invented by Scottish photographer Mungo Ponton in 1839, but was made popular by the pictorialists such as Alfred Stieglitz. Characteristics of gum bichromate contact prints are low-level details, broad tones, and high contrasts, resembling pastel or charcoal drawings. The chemical methodology relies on the light sensitivity of dichromates. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.168)</p>
<h4>Lumen prints</h4>
<p>Similar to photograms and cyanotypes, this process requires placing objects, usually plants, directly on photographic paper to create a contact print, however, the prints are not fully developed. After being exposed to the sun or UV light for several hours, the prints are given a brief wash and then placed into a fixer bath. Digital negatives can be used. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.34).</p>
<h4>Salt printing</h4>
<p>A historic process developed by W. H. Fox Talbot, and the dominant contact printing process from 1839 through to 1860s. It gives strong contrasting images with a salt and silver based chemical solution. The silver nitrate needed is expensive. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.156)</p>
<h3>Alternative methods</h3>
<h4>Disposable cameras</h4>
<p>Affordable 35mm cameras that are modifiable or can be applied to collective and conceptual projects. Can be also used to spur projects by scraping/donating working parts.</p>
<h4>Intentional camera movement</h4>
<p>Using slow shutter and narrow apertures to create long exposure times with the addition of the movement of the camera creates blurred images often impressionist and abstract.</p>
<h4>Multiple exposures</h4>
<p>Exposing a recording medium numerous times to create superimposed or layered imagery. This can be done in-camera, digital image manipulation application (photoshop) or via the darkroom with photographic paper.</p>
<h4>Pinhole</h4>
<p>The most basic of form for capturing an image. Using a pinhole as an aperture creates a long exposure and infinite depth of field as the diameter of the pinhole accumulating in a very narrow f-stop. A pinhole can be used instead of a lens when building a camera, simplifying the process. Can also be used for a primitive Camera Obscura and more conceptual projects like Kelly Angoods printable pinhole Hasselblad. The length of time needed to expose the recording medium can typically result in atmospheric and imperfect imagery.</p>
<p>I have various pinhole cameras at my disposal some handmade and some bought like a 6 by 17 panoramic pinhole camera.</p>
<p>Notable pinhole photography sources/projects: Eric Renner, Pinhole photography book. Google Kelly Angood for her printable and popup pinhole camera projects. See Francesco Capponi's conceptual work (pinhole cameras made out of everyday objects) in Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques page 46.</p>
<h4>Scanner camera</h4>
<p>An experimental digital camera upcycling a scanner bed by using it as a large-format recording medium. Images can be unique in that they have 'scan lines' and an almost screen like quality with sharp edges. See Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques page 114, or google Brana Vojnovic.</p>
<h4>Solargraphy</h4>
<p>Solargraphs, surreal images that record the suns trajectory across the sky, are created in a chemical-less process involving a pinhole camera, photographic paper, and time. The paper is loaded into a basic pinhole camera, usually, a watertight vessel such as a can or canister that has been made light-tight, and left in situ for months. This results in lines in the sky where the sun has burnt into the paper its trajectory. The landscape is often silhouetted. Rather than fixing the image in a dark room, it is often scanned quickly as is. See Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques page 56.</p>
<h4>Toy camera</h4>
<p>Plastic film cameras like the holga and diana produce soft and spontaneous imagery.</p>
<h4>Transaquatype</h4>
<p>A straightforward technique of turning inkjet prints into painterly impressionistic images. This is done by applying water to the back of a fresh inkjet print. Could be experimented with if digital mediums or inkjet printing methods are used.</p>
<p>See Experimental Photography: A Handbook of Techniques page 218.</p>
<h3>B:</h3>
<h3>Britain [geographical]</h3>
<p>Britain is varied yet small:</p>
<p>&quot;...the British landscape is human-sized. Like the motto of England's smallest county, Rutland, there is multum in parvo (much in little).&quot; (Pryor 2010, p.preface)</p>
<h3>British [identity]</h3>
<p>The British landscape is mythicized and associated with identity:</p>
<p>&quot;On a daily basis we also encounter idealized imagery of what one's country is supposed to look like. In advertising tableaux, television programs and movies, postcards, posters, and decorative wall art, depictions of our land contribute to a sense of our national identity.&quot; (Alexander 2015, p.145)</p>
<h3>Burnstine, Susan [photographer]</h3>
<p>&quot;Susan Burnstine is one of the few photographers today avidly pursuing alternative processes to create an idiosyncratic and deeply personal visual landscape. Initially, Burnstine sought to find a way to portray her dream-like visions entirely in-camera, rather than with post-processing digital manipulations. To achieve this, she has created twenty-one handmade film cameras and lenses that are frequently unpredictable and technically challenging. The cameras are primarily made out of plastic, vintage camera parts, and random household objects, with single-element lenses molded from plastic and rubber. Learning to overcome their extensive optical limitations required Burnstine to rely on instinct and intuition--the same tools that are key when attempting to interpret dreams.&quot; (Burnstine n.d.)</p>

<p>(Burnstine n.d.)</p>
<h3>C:</h3>
<h3>Camera obscura.</h3>
<p>Latin for &quot;dark room&quot;, the earliest method of capturing (but not fixing) an image. Described by Aristotle and sketched by Leonardo da Vinci, the ancient method has been combined and reimagined by contemporary artists. (Antonini et al. 2015, p.14)</p>
<h3>Conservation [political]</h3>
<p>Conservation vs imported species of plants:</p>
<p>&quot;Is it illogical to seek to save these plants, even in the knowledge that they were brought here by humans? They do no harm and afford delight and wonder to those who appreciate them, which is surely all that is required to make something worthy of preservation. Even so, it compounds the confusion – seldom acknowledged, let alone resolved – between conservation and gardening.&quot; (Monbiot 2014b, p.114)</p>
<p>Deforestation campaigns:</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder whether our campaigns against deforestation elsewhere in the world, commendable as they may be, are a way of not seeing what has happened in our own country.&quot; (Monbiot 2014b, p.68)</p>
<p>Heather as an indicator for lowland deforestation not beauty :</p>
<p>&quot;Heather, which many nature-lovers in Britain cherish, is typical of the hardy, shrubby plants which colonize deforested land. I have seen similar landscapes of low scrub in Brazil, Indonesia and Africa, where logging, burning and shifting cultivation have depleted the soil. I do not see heather moor as an indicator of the health of the upland environment, as many do, but as a product of ecological destruction.&quot; (Monbiot 2014b, p.68)</p>
<p>Warick singles out the national rail network for its untouched land:</p>
<p>&quot;I know Network Rail is not a conservation organisation, but they are in possession of 30,000 hectares of land that is largely untouched, unbothered and wild. That is over half the area of the New Forest National Park.&quot; (Warwick 2017, p.161)</p>
<h3>D:</h3>
<h3>Darkroom (resource)</h3>
<p>A subdued or complete darkroom can be used for experimental or traditional photographic printing processes as well as aiding light-sensitive materials into equipment. I have a minimalist darkroom for film processing at home and the more equiped uni darkroom (colour and black and white) at my disposal.</p>
<h3>E:</h3>
<h3>Edgelands [Geographical]</h3>
<p>&quot;The edgelands are a complex landscape, a debatable zone, constantly reinventing themselves as economic and social tides come in and out.&quot; (Farley &amp; Roberts 2012, p.6)</p>
<p>&quot;At their most unruly and chaotic, edgelands make a great deal of our official wilderness seem like the enshrined, ecologically arrested, controlled garden space it really is. Children and teenagers, as well as lawbreakers, have seemed to feel especially at home in them, the former because they have yet to establish a sense of taste and boundaries, and have instinctively treated their jungle spaces as a vast playground; the latter because nobody is looking.&quot; (Farley &amp; Roberts 2012, p.8)</p>
<h3>F:</h3>
<h3>Fauna</h3>
<p>Mammal.org.uk states that the British Isles have 101 mammal species of which:</p>
<p>28 native terrestrial mammals, 2 native marine mammals</p>
<p>18 native bats</p>
<p>13 introduced or naturalised species</p>
<p>5 terrestrial island mammals</p>
<p>25 cetaceans found in and around our waters</p>
<p>8 vagrant mammals: 3 bat species and 5 pinnipedia (found only occasionally)</p>
<p>4 feral species and 2 domesticated / managed species (Anon n.d.)</p>
<p>Also, see Wild animals</p>
<h3>Flora</h3>
<p>Native flora is limited, compared to other counties:</p>
<p>The native British flora is today relatively impoverished. Today the British Isles has a flora of only about 1500 species of native flowering plants. France and Spain, each geographically only about twice the area, have 3-4 times as many species each. (Ingrouille 1995, p.Preface i)</p>
<p>Flora is a traditional subject matter for Cyanotype and still life.</p>

<h3>Invasive non-native flora [series idea]</h3>
<p>For example the buddleia, butterfly bush. A BBC news article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;More people are buying buddleia for their gardens, but it's classified as an invasive species and is a problem on British railways. It's hard to walk by a railway line in Britain and not see buddleia. Along fences by the tracks and almost any patch of waste ground, you will notice the long, slender clumps of flowers, usually lilac but also blue, deeper purple or white, at the end of long, arching branches.&quot; (Gupta 2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rob Cowen describes the Buddleia or 'butterfly bush' escape from Kew Gardens and into the urban landscape:</p>
<p>The species had come a long way since its seeds were sent to London's Kew Gardens from China almost a hundred years earlier. Becoming renowned for its late trusses of colourful flowers and a honey-rich scent irresistible to insects and butterflies, it had earned the colloquial name of 'The Butterfly Bush' and quickly spread throughout England as a much-prized garden shrub. But buddleia wasn't content to be contained for long. Pavement cracks, waste ground, development land, walls, chimneys and shingle banks turned out to be ideal replicas of the rocky screen of its native Sichuan province. By 1922, it had jumped the fence and wild bushes were being reported in all manner of strange and sheer places, rampantly colonising Britain's railway network. Erupting from trackside tunnels and bridges, its rootstock was decried as weakening surfaces and structures and the plant swiftly fell from favour.</p>
<p>Cowen, Rob. Common Ground (p. 243,244)</p>
<p>Cowen continues by discussing the paradoxical relationship of the bush with conservationists, gardeners and wildlife enthusiasts:</p>
<p>&quot;Conservation charities, initially wary of the risks an invasive species posed to biodiversity, recognised that buddleia's abundance was creating crucial feeding sites for many species of bees, butterflies and moths. And it was the same story in gardens, for despite its demonisation in official quarters, buddleia had never ceased to be cherished closer to home. Being an exotic-looking shrub, a magnet for wildlife and requiring little or no looking after, it had been planted continually by gardeners&quot;</p>
<p>Cowen, Rob. Common Ground (p.,244)</p>
<p>Other possible routes of research are other invasive species: Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam</p>
<p>Weeds such as Bindweed are common sites on industrial, edgeland, and wastelands.</p>

<h3>Kenna, Michael [photographer].</h3>
<p>Landscape photographer who uses hasselblads but also holga toy cameras.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always considered the make and format of camera to be ultimately low on the priority scale when it comes to making pictures. I think personal vision is far more important. A sense of esthetics, a personal connection with the subject matter, an enquiring and inquisitive mind – these factors outweigh whatever equipment you use.&quot; (Kenna 2014)</p>

<h3>L:</h3>
<h3>Landscape [geographical]</h3>
<p>&quot;Landscape pictures can offer us … three verities – geography, autobiography, and metaphor. Geography is, if taken alone, sometimes boring, autobiography is frequently trivial, and metaphor can be dubious. But taken together, as in the best work of people like Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston, the three kings of information strengthen each other and reinforce what we all work to keep intact – an affection for life.&quot; (Adams 1989, p.14)</p>
<p>Landscape as representation and as a response:</p>
<p>&quot;Landscape . . . can be seen, as it was in nineteenth-century debates, as a general name for substances—it can mean bricks and mortar, leaves and fields, the desert, automobiles on a street, overcast or sunny skies, rural and suburban trees, concrete architecture, ghettos, a seascape at night, a seaside resort, the post-conflict rubble of a war-torn city, a tourist resort, industrial spaces, interiors or panoramic views. &quot;Landscape&quot; is not all things to all people, but a highly differentiated discourse on representing space.&quot;<a href=""></a> <a href="https://paperpile.com/c/xIRAsH/eOfE/?locator=93">(Bate 2009, p.93)</a></p>
<p>&quot;Landscape is therefore not the land or the space or the topography but rather the processes involved in its representation.&quot; (Alexander 2015, pp.11–12)</p>

<h3>National parks [geographical]</h3>
<p>The UK's national parks often spark political and environmental criticism while also being of contemporary and historically significant in relation to the British identity. For example, the Peak District has 13.25 million visitors every year, has various locations used in film, 2,900 listed buildings and an economy heavily reliant on tourism (Peak District National Park n.d.). George Monbiot criticised national trust's grouse-shooting practices within the park in an article titled 'Britain's national parks are a farce: they're being run for a tiny minority' (Monbiot 2018). There could several routes of enquiry from politics and conservation to history and identity.</p>

<h3>P:</h3>
<h3>Peak District [geographical].</h3>
<p>I live close (acceptable distance via public transport) to the national park. I have completed personal projects on the landscape there as well as using the landscape present there as the basis for my dissertation on alternative cameras in landscape photography.</p>
<h3>Psychogeography</h3>
<p>&quot;Psychogeography describes the effect of a geographical location on the emotions and behaviour of individuals (Tate n.d.)</p>
<p>Marxist in philosophic origin, psychogeography was spurred in the 1980s by British writers Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd exploring London by foot, and invented with the emergence of urban exploration in the 2000s. &quot;This nascent popular movement, which involves people rediscovering the hidden aspects of local environments, appears to reflect a widespread desire to rediscover place as a site of adventure. Psychogeography is on the furthest margins of the discipline of geography and has attracted little scholarly attention.&quot; (Bonnett 2013)</p>
<h3>Q:</h3>
<h3>R:</h3>
<h3>Realism</h3>
<p>My photographic style often looks beyond realism. Realism is:</p>
<p>&quot;A philosophical theory that holds that things exist irrespective of what we think or know about them. Most people are realists when it comes to physical facts about the world.&quot; (la Grange 2013, p.243)</p>
<p>Throughout 'On Photography', Sontag argues that the photograph is an object or document of reality taken at a moment:</p>
<p>&quot;Each still photograph is a privileged moment, turned into a slim object that one can keep and look at again.&quot; (Sontag 1977, p.18)</p>
<p>Max Kozloff disagrees with Sontag, stating that it is the belief of photographs that holds the illusion of reality in photographs. Kozloff sees the photograph as a witness rather than exact mirrored reality, of which the viewer can verify.</p>
<p>&quot;Though infested with many bewildering anomalies, photographs are considered our best arbiters between our visual perceptions and the memory of them. It is not only their apparent 'objectivity' that grants photographs their high status in this regard, but our belief that in them, fugitive sensation has been laid to rest. The presence of photographs reveals how circumscribed we are in the throes of sensing. We perceive and interpret the outer world through a set of incredibly fine internal receptors. But we are incapable, by ourselves, of grasping or tweezing out any permanent, sharable figment of it. Practically speaking, we ritually verify what is there, and are disposed to call it reality. But, with photographs, we have concrete proof that we have not been hallucinating all our lives.&quot; (Kozloff 1979, p.101)</p>
<p>David Bates, in 'photography: the key concepts', states a similar argument to Kozloff but points to semiotics as a key to breaking the illusion of reality within photographs:</p>
<p>&quot;… realism is right to argue that I look at the picture as though I was there. However, semiotics also reminds me that this famous reality effect is a product of the codes of geometry and perspective, which have enabled my imaginary identification with the camera. 'I' am not there, the camera is, but the feeling that 'I am there' comes from the identification with the position of the camera. What the photographer has done, for example, is not to show us reality but to position the camera so as to organize elements – things in the world – into a rhetorical argument, even our sense of being there&quot; (Bate 2009, p.38)</p>
<h3>Reality</h3>
<p>&quot;...photography is not bound by any obligation to <strong>reality</strong> ; like any other art, it is a set of resources which can be put to a variety of uses, and out of which a style can be forged&quot; (Scott 1999, p.22)</p>
<p>Needing to have <strong>reality</strong> confirmed and experience enhanced by photographs is an aesthetic consumerism to which everyone is now addicted. (Sontag 1977, p.22)</p>
<h3>Rewilding [political]</h3>
<p>Rewinding vs conservation:</p>
<p>&quot;... rewilding, unlike conservation, has no fixed objective: it is driven not by human management but by natural processes. There is no point at which it can be said to have arrived. Rewilding of the kind that interests me does not seek to control the natural world, to re-create a particular ecosystem or landscape, but–having brought back some of the missing species–to allow it to find its own way.&quot; (Monbiot 2014a, p.93)</p>
<p>Also see Conservation</p>
<h3>Roberts, Simon [photographer]</h3>
<p>Projects: We English, The weeds and the wilderness</p>
<p>Simon Roberts's major project We English is a survey of the contemporary English landscape and picks out peculiarities and eccentricities, as well as more commonplace activities of its inhabitants. While the project is likely to be immediately accessible to British audiences, there is a danger this kind of project might leave foreign audiences at a loss as to how to interpret the subject matter or even how to confine a nation to conformed stereotypes. (Alexander 2015, p.148)</p>
<h3>Rural [geographical]</h3>
<p>The rural countryside as an idealised tourist destination and the urban/rural divide:</p>
<p>&quot;People are let out into the country . . . there are nice benches and lavatories, but they don't really experience the country and they don't understand the problems of the countryside. And so there is more and more polarization between people who live in big cities and people who live in the country. Some city dwellers . . . like to know that these spaces are still here, but one can become very unrealistic by saying that an area shouldn't be spoilt by a fish factory or various other things that the local population need in order to survive. If there is nothing at all for people to do, the only work for people in this sort of area will be services for hotels, and that is totally unreal. (Godwin 1986)</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Idealised 'little england' rural landscape vs modern contemporary landscape:</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst the multiculturalism of many British cities is acknowledged and celebrated, the rural retains an association with Anglo-Celtic lineages which is simultaneously literal (the rural population is less evidently multi-ethnic), imaginary and, perhaps, desired. The rural becomes a refuge for 'little England' associations. 'Postcard England' can be seen as an attempt to hold on to something that never quite existed, that seems to represent a resistance to modernity – let alone post-modernity – and certainly does not acknowledge contemporary heterogeneity in terms of ethnicity and identity.&quot; (Wells 2011, p.205)</p>
<p>Rural countryside vs the notion of wild:</p>
<p>&quot;American author William Least-Heat Moon described Britain as 'a tidy garden of a toy realm where there's almost no real wilderness left and absolutely no memory of it. Where the woods are denatured plantings. The English, the Europeans, are too far from the wild.&quot; (Macfarlane 2009, p.9)</p>
<h3>S:</h3>
<h3>Smith, James E. [photographer/artist]</h3>
<p>Exhibition: 'call to action', 2016, comprised of 221 giclée prints on Hahnemuhle.</p>
<p>Smith created a geometric collage of black and white prints depicting his experience of urban Australia and its &quot;constantly evolving human-altered landscape&quot; (Lincs Scene 2017). This psychogeographic/topographic approach to a landscape project had Smith focus on capitalism in the form of advertisements and slogans present in the landscape, as well as poverty in the form of graffiti and rubbish.</p>
<h3>Subjugation of land [political]</h3>
<p>&quot;I'm troubled by the thought that when acres of wood, fen, mountain marsh, coast or grassland become designated wildlife sanctuaries, they also become another type of no-go area, enclosed by a new class of landowner – countryside managers, conservationists and large charities. No one would question that theirs is noble, well-meaning work, but it's still shutting us out. The human is reduced to the neutral observer, removed and peering in from the prescribed path, the car park, café or picnic table. 'Environmentally friendly' subjugation of land is still subjugation, the process of shaping it to conform to what we want it to be&quot;. (Cowen 2016, p.137)</p>
<h3>T:</h3>
<h4>Third landscape</h4>
<p>&quot;The Third Landscape&quot; is a broad category of areas of nonhuman landscape</p>
<p>evolution; the more specific &quot;les délaissés&quot; are leftover places colonized by</p>
<p>wild plants and animals.</p>
<h3>Trains/transport [series idea]</h3>
<p>I recently started taking a series of images on my morning commute of landscapes via the train window using slow shutter speeds and intentional camera movement.</p>
<h3>U:</h3>
<h3>V:</h3>
<h3>W:</h3>
<h4>Walking</h4>
<p>Walking can also be imagined as a visual activity, every walk a tour leisurely enough both to see and to think over the sights, to assimilate the new into the known. Perhaps this is where walking's peculiar utility for thinkers comes from.</p>
<p>Wanderlust page 6</p>
<p>Walking is a matter not just of truth, but also of reality. To walk is to experience the real. Not reality as pure physical exteriority or as what might count as a subject, but reality as what holds good: the principle of solidity, of resistance. When you walk you prove it with every step: the earth holds good. With every pace, the entire weight of my body finds support and rebounds, takes a spring. There is everywhere a solid base somewhere underfoot.</p>
<p>A philosophy of walking page 96</p>
<h3>Weston, Edward [quote]</h3>
<p>&quot;...richness of control facilities often acts as a barrier to creative work. The fact is that relatively few photographers ever master their medium. Instead they allow the medium to master them and go on an endless squirrel cage chase from new lens to new paper to new developer to new gadget, never staying with one piece of equipment long enough to learn its full capacities, becoming lost in a maze of technical information that is of little or no use since they don't know what to do with it.&quot; (Weston 1983, p.142)</p>
<h3>Wilderness [geographical]</h3>
<p>E. M. Forster in 1964 wrote that two world wars had enveloped the wildness of Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;'Two great wars demanded and bequeathed regimentation,' wrote E. M. Forster in 1964, 'science lent her aid, and the wildness of these islands, never extensive, was stamped upon and built over and patrolled in no time. There is no forest or fell to escape to today, no cave in which to curl up, and no deserted valley. (Macfarlane 2009, p.8)</p>
<p>Jonathan Raban claims Britain lost its wilderness much earlier in the 1860s with population and industry:</p>
<p>&quot;so thickly peopled, so intensively farmed, so industrialised, so citified, that there was nowhere to go to be truly alone, or to have … adventures, except to sea&quot;. (Jonathan Raban Cited in (Macfarlane 2009, p.8))</p>
<p>Macfarlane states population and the road network is really to blame for the lack of wilderness or remoteness:</p>
<p>&quot;In Britain, over sixty-one million people now live in 93,000 square miles of land. Remoteness has been almost abolished, and the main agents of that abolition have been the car and the road. Only a small and diminishing proportion of terrain is now more than five miles from a motorable surface. There are nearly thirty million cars in use in Britain, and 210,000 miles of road on the mainland alone.&quot; (Macfarlane 2009, p.9)</p>
<p>George Monbiot argues that there is a wildness paradox, that britain's gardens have more wildlife in them than barren uplands:</p>
<p>&quot;Spend two hours sitting in a bushy suburban garden anywhere in Britain, and you are likely to see more birds, and of a wider range of species, than you would while walking five miles across almost any open landscape in the uplands.&quot;(Monbiot 2014b, p.69)</p>
<p>Liz Wells argues Britain is a managed land and notes the paradox of the pictorial countryside as safe, clean, and undisturbed rather than managed.</p>
<p>&quot;... <strong>British land is managed – there is no wilderness</strong> ; even the coastal littoral is overseen (by the Environment Agency). It follows that landscapes and vistas are human constructs, which means that aesthetic principles, as well as social mores, were and are in play within the actual shaping of land. Pictorial renderings of countryside as pastoral depict Britain as undisturbed and undisturbing, thus contributing to constructing a simplified and benign rural imaginary, to picturing countryside as safe.&quot; (Wells 2011, p.164)</p>
<p>The lack of wild animals like wolves, beaver and boar:</p>
<p>&quot;So few wild creatures, relatively, remain in Britain and Ireland: so few, relatively, in the world. Pursuing our project of civilisation, we have pushed thousands of species towards the brink of disappearance, and many thousands more over that edge. The loss, after it is theirs, is ours. Wild animals, like wild places, are invaluable to us precisely because they are not us. They are uncompromisingly different.&quot; (Macfarlane 2009, p.306,307)</p>
