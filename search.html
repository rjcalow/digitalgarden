            <li data-question-id=100><p><a href=./landscape/wilderness.html>Wilderness in Britain</a></p> <section><div class=snippet>Wilderness in Britain <blockquote><p>E. M. Forster in 1964 wrote that two world wars had enveloped the wildness of Britain. ‚Äú‚ÄòTwo great wars demanded and bequeathed regimentation,‚Äô wrote E. M. Forster in 1964, ‚Äòscience lent her aid, and the wildness of these islands, never extensive, was stamped upon and built over and patrolled in no time. There is no forest or fell to escape to today, no cave in which to curl up, and no deserted valley.‚Äô‚Äù (Macfarlane 2009, p.8)</blockquote><p>Jonathan Raban claims Britain lost its wilderness much earlier in the 1860s with population and industry:<blockquote><p>so thickly peopled, so intensively farmed, so industrialised, so citified, that there was nowhere to go to be truly alone, or to have ‚Ä¶ adventures, except to sea. (Jonathan Raban Cited in (Macfarlane 2009, p.8))</blockquote><p>Macfarlane states population and the road network is really to blame for the lack of wilderness or remoteness:<blockquote><p>In Britain, over sixty-one million people now live in 93,000 square miles of land. Remoteness has been almost abolished, and the main agents of that abolition have been the car and the road. Only a small and diminishing proportion of terrain is now more than five miles from a motorable surface. There are nearly thirty million cars in use in Britain, and 210,000 miles of road on the mainland alone. (Macfarlane 2009, p.9)</blockquote><p>George Monbiot argues that there is a wildness paradox, that Britain's gardens have more wildlife in them than barren uplands:<blockquote><p>Spend two hours sitting in a bushy suburban garden anywhere in Britain, and you are likely to see more birds, and of a wider range of species, than you would while walking five miles across almost any open landscape in the uplands. (Monbiot 2014, p.69)</blockquote><p>Liz Wells argues Britain is a managed land and notes the paradox of the pictorial countryside as safe, clean, and undisturbed rather than managed.<blockquote><p>...<strong>British land is managed ‚Äì there is no wilderness</strong>; even the coastal littoral is overseen (by the Environment Agency). It follows that landscapes and vistas are human constructs, which means that aesthetic principles, as well as social mores, were and are in play within the actual shaping of land. Pictorial renderings of countryside as pastoral depict Britain as undisturbed and undisturbing, thus contributing to constructing a simplified and benign rural imaginary, to picturing countryside as safe. (Wells 2011, p.164)</blockquote><p>The lack of wild animals like wolves, beaver and boar:<blockquote><p>So few wild creatures, relatively, remain in Britain and Ireland: so few, relatively, in the world. Pursuing our project of civilisation, we have pushed thousands of species towards the brink of disappearance, and many thousands more over that edge. The loss, after it is theirs, is ours. Wild animals, like wild places, are invaluable to us precisely because they are not us. They are uncompromisingly different.

It attempts to prevent animals and plants from either leaving or‚Äìif they do not live there already‚Äìentering. It seeks to manage nature as if tending a garden. Many of the ecosystems, such as heath and moorland, blanket bog and rough grass, that it tries to preserve are dominated by the low, scrubby vegetation which remains after forests have been repeatedly cleared and burnt. <mark> This vegetation is cherished by wildlife groups, which prevent it from reverting to woodland through intensive grazing by sheep, cattle and horses.

These are out of town areas where the socially marginal meet for questionable or immoral activities. These dystopias are enforced and exploited through film and tv. Throughout the 1990's the backdrop of the indie crime movie was an edgeland site. The place where <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLyajC5-gFs>money is exchanged</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaco4Ea5nXY>money is stolen</a>, and the criminal-protagonist cover is <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rdS5O7vo>walking the dog</a>. Of course, the edginess is hyperbole, visually enhanced with banal industrial architecture, debris and monotonous colour balances. Film portrays them as landscapes where concluding conflict is played out. In reality, these areas, besides the occasional glimpses of marginal society (the attempted dog theft) spurring suspicion, are not straightforward dystopias but banal urban peripheries with complex social processes.<p>Author of the term:<blockquote><p>The aura of excitement which goes with the apparent lawlessness of the edgelands has been exploited in such films of the 1990s as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Things to Do in Denver When you‚Äôre Dead, Fargo and The Straight Story. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)</blockquote><p>[[Roberts, M. S.]] co-author of edgelands <em>Journeys Into England's True Wilderness</em> (2011):<blockquote><p>Marion Shoard‚Äôs coining of ‚Äòedgelands‚Äô seemed to conjure exactly our experience of these places. They were, and are, edgy. In British tv drama and low budget films, the edgelands are always the place of the d√©nouement, the place where the drug gang is busted, the car chase ends, or the kidnap victim is rescued. These are places where anything could happen. And when it did, it was usually illegal or contravened every rule of health and safety. This sense of the edgelands as a dystopian landscape is a familiar trope of British popular culture in particular. (Roberts, 2016, pp. 19‚Äì20)</blockquote><h4>Bibliography for this note</h4><p>Roberts, M. S.

The French term terrain connotes a more urban quality than the English land; thus terrain is an extension of the precisely limited ground fit for construction, for the city.‚Äù (de Sol√†- Morales, 2013, p. 26).</blockquote><h2>Breaking down the etymology</h2><ul><li>The term has duality stemming from Latin: ‚ÄúVague descends from vacuus, giving us ‚Äúvacant‚Äù and ‚Äúvacuum‚Äù in English, which is to say ‚Äúempty, unoccupied,‚Äù yet also ‚Äúfree, available, unengaged.‚Äù<li>A second meaning superimposed on the French vague derives from the Latin vagus, giving ‚Äúvague‚Äù in English, too, in the sense of <mark>‚Äúindeterminate, imprecise, blurred, uncertain.‚Äù</mark> (de Sol√†- Morales, 2013, p. 26).<li>Sol√†- Morales uses the french term ‚Äòterrain vague‚Äô because the English vocabulary for these pockets of vacant landscape have negative connotations such as wasteland.</ul><h2>My favourite explanation</h2><p>Stanka Radoviƒá has a clear definition in the essay ‚Äòon the threshold‚Äô - an essay using the Andrei Tarkovsky 1979 film, Stalker, to explore the term as a utopia:<blockquote><p>‚Äú... terrain vague escapes and challenges rigid definitions. Is it urban or is it natural? Is it a concept or a concrete place? Free or forlorn? The term ‚Äúterrain vague‚Äù translates into English as ‚Äúwasteland,‚Äù ‚Äúderelict area,‚Äù or ‚Äúvacant land,‚Äù and refers to abandoned or unoccupied portions of urban land that remain available for spontaneous use.‚Äù (Radoviƒá, 2013, p. 114)</blockquote><h2>Early photography</h2><h3>Man Ray Etude pour terrain vague , 1929</h3><p><img alt src=../imgs/man_ray_terrain_vague.jpg><p>Before de Sol√†- Morales, Man Ray, inspired by Eug√®ne Atget, captioned these photographs 'Terrain Vague'.<h3>Bibliography</h3><p>Radoviƒá, S.

(2017) Domestic Wild. Memory, Nature and Gardening in Suburbia</a></p> <section><div class=snippet>Ginn, F. (2017) Domestic Wild. Memory, Nature and Gardening in Suburbia <h3>Regarding nature and culture dichotomy</h3><blockquote><p>Instead of a nature‚Äìculture dualism that has been eroded by historical events, a broad movement across the social sciences and social theory has advanced the claim that the world has always been comprised of entanglements between humans, creatures and agents of all kinds. This movement has been inspired by the philosophies of, among others, Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway and Gilles Deleuze and their antipathy to ontological hygiene. (Ginn, 2017, p. 5)</blockquote><p>Ginn points to philosophers such as Bruno Latour, who‚Äôs 1991 work, <em>Nous n'avons jamais √©t√© modernes</em>, argues the dichotomy never existed.<blockquote><p>‚Ä¶ nature and culture are conceptual abstractions and so our present era ‚Äì although it is an era of great loss ‚Äì is not a loss of the wild brought about by the enclosure of nature within culture. Rather, the twenty-first century has witnessed a step-change in the intensity of planetary circulation and metabolism (Ginn, 2017, p. 5).</blockquote><p>Ginn states that culture has not consumed nature (extinctions), but connected with nature through an increasing number of interconnections at a global level. This reminds me of fig.1.1 in Latours translated, <em>We have never been modern?</em> (Latour, 1993, p. 11) in which nonhuman nature and human culture are depicted along a second dichotomy separating the nature-culture dualism with that of a hybridised network of connections.<p><img alt src=../../imgs/333443243.jpg><blockquote><p>Gardening shrugs in the face of the nature‚Äìculture dualism. Gardening has never really been something done by humans to plants, but has always been a process of mutually beneficial interkingdom exchange. (Ginn, 2017, p. 6).</blockquote><p>In relation to <a class=wikilink href=../../search.html?=gardening>gardening</a>, the interconnections between nature-culture are apparent and beneficial for both.<blockquote><p>The Anthropocene seems to unite humanity. But it does so through ‚Äòour‚Äô unequally shared vulnerability to forces of capitalist world ecology and global environmental change. Instead of being united by negative unity ‚Äì that of vulnerability and loss ‚Äì might we not seek a more compassionate and affirmative acknowledgement of unity? Gardening, as the domestic wild, might allow us a way to imagine an earthly ethos fit for the Anthropocene. (Ginn, 2017, p. 142)</blockquote><p>Ginn‚Äôs concluding message is that gardening may provide a force for good in the anthropocene landscape as a positive interconnection between nonhuman and human culture.<h3>Bibliography</h3><p>Ginn, F.

(2000) ‚ÄòBeyond the Nature-Culture Dualism‚Äô</a></p> <section><div class=snippet>Haila, Y. (2000) ‚ÄòBeyond the Nature-Culture Dualism‚Äô <h2>Introduction</h2><h4>Haila uses straightforward language in the opening paragraph to describe the dichotomy:</h4><blockquote><p>Culture may be viewed as an agent that actively strives for domination over nature, or as a malicious tumor that tends to grow and exceed the limits set by nature. Nature may be regarded as a source of hardships and catastrophs that needs to be mastered by human rational action or, alternatively, as benign providence that offers advice. The common denominator of all these varieties is that culture and nature are opposite sides in a dualism. (Haila, 2000, p. 155)</blockquote><h4>Nature as the ‚Äúother‚Äù:</h4><blockquote><p>On the level of cultural identity, nature is such an ‚Äúother‚Äù. The relationship to the ‚Äúother‚Äù is asymmetric and implies domination; Plumwood (1993) elaborates on this point. For instance, in oppositions such as male-female, city-country, and reason-emotion the second term is the ‚Äúother‚Äù for the first one which is the dominant term. Similarly, culture, by being the sphere in which human historical identity is formed, is dominant to its ‚Äúother‚Äù, nature; culture becomes a ‚Äúsomething‚Äù in opposition to ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù which is nature‚Ä¶ (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</blockquote><p>Haila points to Descartes and cartesian thinking:<blockquote><p>Subject-object relationships and the ensuing dualisms become elevated to a metaphysical postulate that the subject-object dichotomy is an essential determinant of human existence. We owe this move largely to Descartes who drew a strict distinction between res cogitas and res extensa; the apparent necessity as well as the inadequacy of the Cartesian dualism have been recognized and analyzed by a number of authors (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</blockquote><h2>Pervasive dualism</h2><p>Haila is concerned with the effects of the dualism on Environmentalism:<blockquote><p>The form particularly relevant in ecological thinking in the era of the ecological crisis is as follows: We want to know what nature allows us. To reach an ultimate certainty we would like to distinguish between ‚Äúnature by herself as a standard‚Äù and ‚Äúnature modified and polluted by humans‚Äù. This, however, cannot be done. Humans are creatures of nature; consequently, discriminating between phenomena of nature as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and phenomena of culture as ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù does not make sense at all. Furthermore, as nature changes continuously due to natural processes, the fact that human actions change nature cannot be a diagnostic feature of their ‚Äúunnaturalness‚Äù (Haila, 2000, p. 157).</blockquote><p>Haila‚Äôs argument that we want to standardise nature, reminds me of Monbiot‚Äôs arguments against idealistic conservation:<blockquote><p>‚Ä¶ the conservation movement, while well intentioned, sought to freeze living systems in time. It attempts to prevent animals and plants from either leaving or‚Äìif they do not live there already‚Äìentering. It seeks to manage nature as if tending a garden (Monbiot, 2014, p. 8)</blockquote><p>Haila points to the models of first and second nature to deconstruct the dualism:<blockquote><p>First nature and second nature form historically unique combinations in different situations and cannot be separated from each other: where, then, is the nature-culture dualism? (Haila, 2000, p. 168).</blockquote><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Haila concludes that the boundary caused by the dualism should be thought of as complex interactions, breaking down the individual and the collective systems:<blockquote><p>‚Ä¶ <mark> the dualism may not be one but many </mark>, constructed in every instantiation anew albeit from common materials ‚Ä¶ the composition and structure of the materials have varied enormously through history. It is not quite obvious whether ‚Äúnature‚Äù has been the same in different cultures except in the abstract sense of being outside each culture, and in the even more abstract sense of being part of the same physical reality (Haila, 2000, pp. 163‚Äì164).<p>...instead of assuming at the outset that humanity and nature form two distinct realms of reality, we ought to view them as merging into situated, historically and contextually specified complexes. Then, the assumed fixed boundary between ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚Äúthe world‚Äù looses meaning (Haila, 2000, p. 171).</blockquote><h3>Bibliography</h3><p>Haila, Y.

So goes the argument of this book.

As people moved to cities, and away from the land, they had to actively seek out nature, as they became physically separated from it. In the pre-industrialized West, the wilderness was often seen as cruel, revolting and ugly</blockquote><p>Romanization of nature:<blockquote><p>from the eighteenth century onwards people began to see the natural landscape in a new way, and with the rise of the Romantic movement in art and poetry, and Transcendentalists such as Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson</blockquote><p>After a brief timeline, Jones discusses post-industrial attitudes to nature and mental health with Victorian/Edwardian asylums having gardens. Followed by contemporary nature therapy and the authors personal interest.<h2>Chapter 1</h2><h3>Mycobacterium vaccae:</h3><blockquote><p>hypothesize that an immune response to M. vaccae stimulates the brain to create more serotonin, the happy chemical that antidepressant pills are designed to boost.</blockquote><p>
