                Culture Nature /  Why Our Minds Need the Wild by Lucy Jones
Contemporary literary work on the British landscape tends to be a focus on nature, wilderness, or wonder. This, however, focuses on the wellbeing and health benefits of nature. Backed by scientific research, it features a substantial scientific and academic bibliography in conjunction with accessible writing.
Introduction chapter
Terms
Psychoterratic - mental health in relation to the earth.

Psychoterratic illnesses, for example, are earth-related mental health issues such as ecoanxiety and global dread.


Solastalgia - is when your endemic sense of place is being violated. 

‘Solastalgia’ – an admixture of solace, nostalgia and destruction – describes a feeling of nostalgia and powerlessness about a place that once brought solace which has been destroyed.

Species loneliness:

...to mean a collective sorrow and anxiety arising from our disconnection from other species.

I enjoyed and agreed with this:

...it would appear that industrialized society perceives nature to be little more than a nicety: a luxury, an extra, a garnish – ‘Green crap’, as the former prime minister David Cameron reportedly called environmental policies


Brief timeline of cultures relationship with nature
Arcadia:

Virgil’s account of Arcadia, from his Eclogues (also known as the Bucolics), was a landscape of comfort and healing – with its cool springs, zephyrs, laurels and tamarisks – for Gallus, who was dying of a broken heart.

Industrialization:

...as the West became industrialized and our contact and connection with the natural world around us dwindled. As people moved to cities, and away from the land, they had to actively seek out nature, as they became physically separated from it. In the pre-industrialized West, the wilderness was often seen as cruel, revolting and ugly

Romanization of nature:

from the eighteenth century onwards people began to see the natural landscape in a new way, and with the rise of the Romantic movement in art and poetry, and Transcendentalists such as Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson


After a brief timeline, Jones discusses post-industrial attitudes to nature and mental health with Victorian/Edwardian asylums having gardens. Followed by contemporary nature therapy and the authors personal interest. 
Chapter 1
Mycobacterium vaccae:

hypothesize that an immune response to M. vaccae stimulates the brain to create more serotonin, the happy chemical that antidepressant pills are designed to boost.



Our microbiota are healthiest when they are diverse – and a diverse microbiota is influenced positively by an environment filled with organisms, which are found more abundantly in outside spaces than inside.

Jones shares Tim Ingold's analogy "...these histories are woven, along with the life-cycles of plants and animals, into the texture of the surface itself (Ingold, 2000, p. 198)."

we are woven into the land, and wider ecosystems, more than we realize

Figures

Studies show that just two hours in a forest can significantly lower cytokine levels in the blood, soothing inflammation.



In animal studies, T-cells (cells which modulate the immune system) have a surprisingly long half-life of twenty-seven days. This suggests that your post-gardening high could keep you buzzing for days, or even weeks.

Chapter 3

We are genetically connected to the natural world
We prefer biological activity from birth 
A 2009 study by the Norwegian institute of public health concluded biophilia can be encouraged with positive effects or discouraged with negative effects.

Chapter 6

Robert Taylor homes , public housing study

Chapter 7


Inequality and marginalized groups have less connection to nature. 



Socioeconomic inequality in mental wellbeing was 40% narrower among people reporting good access to green / recreational areas compared to those with poor access

                Culture Nature /  Introduction
Haila uses straightforward language in the opening paragraph to describe the dichotomy:

Culture may be viewed as an agent that actively strives for domination over nature, or as a malicious tumor that tends to grow and exceed the limits set by nature. Nature may be regarded as a source of hardships and catastrophs that needs to be mastered by human rational action or, alternatively, as benign providence that offers advice. The common denominator of all these varieties is that culture and nature are opposite sides in a dualism. (Haila, 2000, p. 155)

Nature as the “other”:

On the level of cultural identity, nature is such an “other”. The relationship to the “other” is asymmetric and implies domination; Plumwood (1993) elaborates on this point. For instance, in oppositions such as male-female, city-country, and reason-emotion the second term is the “other” for the first one which is the dominant term. Similarly, culture, by being the sphere in which human historical identity is formed, is dominant to its “other”, nature; culture becomes a “something” in opposition to “something else” which is nature… (Haila, 2000, p. 157).

Haila points to Descartes and cartesian thinking:

Subject-object relationships and the ensuing dualisms become elevated to a metaphysical postulate that the subject-object dichotomy is an essential determinant of human existence. We owe this move largely to Descartes who drew a strict distinction between res cogitas and res extensa; the apparent necessity as well as the inadequacy of the Cartesian dualism have been recognized and analyzed by a number of authors (Haila, 2000, p. 157).

Pervasive dualism
Haila is concerned with the effects of the dualism on Environmentalism:

The form particularly relevant in ecological thinking in the era of the ecological crisis is as follows: We want to know what nature allows us. To reach an ultimate certainty we would like to distinguish between “nature by herself as a standard” and “nature modified and polluted by humans”. This, however, cannot be done. Humans are creatures of nature; consequently, discriminating between phenomena of nature as “natural” and phenomena of culture as “unnatural” does not make sense at all. Furthermore, as nature changes continuously due to natural processes, the fact that human actions change nature cannot be a diagnostic feature of their “unnaturalness” (Haila, 2000, p. 157).

Haila’s argument that we want to standardise nature, reminds me of Monbiot’s arguments against idealistic conservation:

… the conservation movement, while well intentioned, sought to freeze living systems in time. It attempts to prevent animals and plants from either leaving or–if they do not live there already–entering. It seeks to manage nature as if tending a garden (Monbiot, 2014, p. 8)

Haila points to the models of first and second nature to deconstruct the dualism:

First nature and second nature form historically unique combinations in different situations and cannot be separated from each other: where, then, is the nature-culture dualism? (Haila, 2000, p. 168).

Conclusion
Haila concludes that the boundary caused by the dualism should be thought of as complex interactions, breaking down the individual and the collective systems: 

…  the dualism may not be one but many , constructed in every instantiation anew albeit from common materials … the composition and structure of the materials have varied enormously through history. It is not quite obvious whether “nature” has been the same in different cultures except in the abstract sense of being outside each culture, and in the even more abstract sense of being part of the same physical reality  (Haila, 2000, pp. 163–164).
...instead of assuming at the outset that humanity and nature form two distinct realms of reality, we ought to view them as merging into situated, historically and contextually specified complexes. Then, the assumed fixed boundary between “I” and “the world” looses meaning (Haila, 2000, p. 171).

A paper, preluding the Urban Wildscape anthology, that discusses ambivalent responses to contemporary urban landscapes where nature is in control. Furthermore, a wilderness is discussed in relation to successional nature found in urban interstitial spaces. Being that ambivalency is a core theme in relation to the urban landscape, this paper was appropriate reading for my essay as well as an introduction to historic anthropocentric views on land and nature. Some of the references and themes are featured and expanded within Jorgensen’s Urban landscape, however, this paper on its own has merit given its focus on liminal ambivalence and ambiguity in relation to culture and nature.
Quotes

From early on in northwest European culture, distinctions have been made between the cultivated area under human control and the surrounding wilderness. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) (1989) defines a wilderness as ‘‘a wild or uncultivated region or tract of land, uninhabited, or inhabited only by wild animals; ‘a tract of solitude or savageness’ (quoted from Johnson’s dictionary)’’. Wilderness is therefore not only the antithesis of human habitation and cultivation, but is also the haunt of wild animals, and may be a place of savagery and danger. (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445).




The idea of wilderness as outside of and opposed to civilization was informed by an anthropocentric world view which sorted the world and everything in it into things humans could derive benefit from, which were therefore good, and things that were useless, which were consequently imbued with moral badness. Thus wilderness, including woodland, was not just outside of civilization, it was an affront to it, and it was a human duty to eradicate it, if the land could be put to better use, which was usually to fields, but the metal industries and especially iron smelting had also taken a heavy toll on forests in England by the 13th century (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 447).
Just as the pre-modern terra nullius was regarded as a void awaiting colonization and exploitation, so contemporary wasteland is frequently regarded as a non-entity, fit for nothing but improvement or development; and as with the old terra nullius, it is often shown as literally blank space on maps and plans (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 452).
If natural and human influences are all mixed up it is impossible to tell whether humans are in control. (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445)
The apparent relaxation of legal and social conventions in interstitial spaces creates welcome opportunities for people to do things that they would not be able to do in any other urban setting, such as young people gathering and travellers setting up encampments (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445).

                Margins /  Jorgensen, A. and Keenan, R.
An anthology of essays discussing urban margins and interstices as urban wildscapes, ambiguous places where users subvert authority and seek recreation in the unregulated territory and autonomous nature. The definition is similar to Shoard, M. (2000) [[Edgelands of Promise]], however, the focus is not on interfacial space but a wider breadth of urban spaces that have a natural agency shaping the land.
Broken into three parts, theorising, case studies and implications for practice, the anthology challenges preconceptions of urban space with the aim of convincing the reader (architects, urban planners, academics, perhaps artists) to engage with autonomous nature through a dichotomous conception of culture and nature. The contributors are from a wide range of disciplines from environmentalists, academic researchers, social scientists, artists, architects and landscape planners. The wide breadth gives the anthology a significant weight for defining these spaces. Additionally, the large number of international contributions, both author and subject wise, provides a western post-industrial perspective with different viewpoints from US and European perspectives. Of the contributions, Jorgensen’s introduction is relatable with its photographic illustrations of Sheffield -locations and scenes I am familiar with, while ‘Places to be wild in nature’ by  Thompson, C. W explores societies relationship with the natural world through public open spaces, ‘Learning from Detroit’ by Woodward, C looks to the post-industrial rust belt of Detroit and its contemporary ruins for inspiration as tourism and urban gardening activities are carried out.

                Margins /  Roberts, M. S. and Farley, P. (2011).
An anthology of essays by English poets, Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts, on the subject of Edgeland -a term originally defined by Marion Shoard for interfacial spaces between urban and rural. The authors use the term, explore the etymology and the characteristics of the space within individual essays, under short direct titles such as paths, dens, gardens and woodlands. The author’s voice, which is indistinguishable with Farley and Roberts writing as one, is melancholic and romantic yet descriptive and accurate of the spaces themselves with the intended audience of psychogeographers and landscape narrative fiction. Farley and Roberts criticise contemporary landscape authors for romanticising wilderness within the British landscape as a misanthropic fascination rather than taking advantage of nearby nature in the Edgelands. The authors also criticise psychogeographer authors and their use of Edgelands as a backdrop and a means of negative misanthropic observations

Marion Shoard’s defining edgelands essay in which observations on the interfacial landscape between urban and rural characterize the space and are argued as spaces for wildlife and plants, in the process questioning if these sites need protection from planners. Though written in 2000 it is still relevant today and is often cited within contemporary work on Edgelands.
Quotes

The edgelands ... are raw and rough, and rather than seeming people-friendly they are often sombre and menacing, flaunting their participation in activities we do not wholly understand. They certainly do not conform to people’s idea of the picturesque by presenting a chocolate-box image, suitably composed and textural. On the contrary, they seem desolate, forsaken and unconnected even to their own elements let alone to our preferred version of human life. (Shoard, 2000, p. 121)
The subversiveness of interfacial land perhaps explains why children often value it more than other groups, seeming to find the edgelands a wonderful place to play. Why? This landscape offers an obviously varied environment which is often wild, with plenty of places to hide and things to play with. Its dereliction stimulates the imagination. This seems to apply not only to children but also to some kinds of creative artist. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)
The aura of excitement which goes with the apparent lawlessness of the edgelands has been exploited in such films of the 1990s as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Things to Do in Denver When you’re Dead, Fargo and The Straight Story. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)
Interfacial sites often enjoy biological diversity partly because they are ignored. Being ignored, they go unmanaged. The clutter of the interface, which would be tidied out of sight by 
those concerned with creating an acceptable landscape there, often enhances wildlife by creating new niches which wild creatures can exploit. (Shoard, 2000, p. 129)

                Margins /  Symmons Roberts, M. (2016), in Habermann, I. and Keller, D. (eds) English Topographies in Literature and Culture.
This keynote originally for the University of Basel, as stated in title, reads as a making-of and commentation of Symmons Roberts co-authored work (2011) Edgelands. Symmons Roberts discusses the rationale, influences and the work itself while providing insight and perspective on the Edgeland space. As the work is more recent than his earlier work (2011) Edgelands and Shoard’s (2000) Edgelands of Promise, this paper reinforces the Edgelands as a contemporary concept. Additionally, Roberts writes about the wilderness aspect of the neglected interfacial space and the subversive edge characteristic. While the language is clear-cut it does not deviate from northern post-industrial sensibility established by the 2011 work, therefore can be seen as an epilogue to the later.
Quotes

In England, they [edgelands] are those interfacial territories that do not fit the titles ‘urban’ or ‘rural’. Largely unplanned, often unwatched, derelict in parts, rapidly shifting with the economic tide, these are places commonly assumed to grow in rings around the edges of towns and cities, defined by what they contain. (Roberts, 2016, p. 18)
England’s edgelands refuse to be held in a tight circle around our urban borders. … In many English cities, the edgelands have refused to remain in the border zone between the outlying housing estates and the first steps of farmland. In some cities, like Manchester and Liverpool, we found them in pockets.  (Roberts, 2016, p. 18)
If the edgelands are not necessarily (or at least, not solely) at the edges of towns and cities, then how are they to be identified? (Roberts, 2016, p. 19)
Marion Shoard’s coining of ‘edgelands’ seemed to conjure exactly our experience of these places. They were, and are, edgy. In British tv drama and low budget films, the edgelands are always the place of the dénouement, the place where the drug gang is busted, the car chase ends, or the kidnap victim is rescued. These are places where anything could happen. And when it did, it was usually illegal or contravened every rule of health and safety. This sense of the edgelands as a dystopian landscape is a familiar trope of British popular culture in particular. (Roberts, 2016, pp. 19–20)
... the edgelands were not simply dystopias. They were the places where, as children, we felt free and inspired. (Roberts, 2016, p. 20)
Why then use the word ‘wilderness’ at all in relation to the edgelands? Well, it is partly their lack of honouring, of lifting up, even of documentation. If a stretch of edgelands – say, the stretch around Barton Bridge on the M60 outside Manchester – is less walked through, less watched, less written about and less managed than a Highlands glen, then is it not more worthy of the term ‘wilderness’? Add to that the un-named qualities of England’s edgelands, and the case is very strong. A place with pools, woodlands, ruins and meadows all without names sounds pretty much like a wilderness to me. (Roberts, 2016, p. 21)

                Margins /  Wells, L. (2011)
An anthology of landscape photography essays written by Liz Wells, an established professor in photographic culture who also edited two popular academic books The Photography Reader and Photography: A Critical Introduction. This anthology, like previous, provides an academic and extensive analysis of its subject both historically and contemporary. The first essay Landscape: Time, Space, Place, Aesthetics is an introductory argument that landscape is a physical space given meaning through human ideological processes. Landscape as art, through a historical narrative, is discussed in relation to landscape as a construct, the values of which are reiterated through representational aesthetics in art. Another essay of interest is Pastoral Heritage: Britain viewed through a critical lens which argues that all land, even the coastal seas, in Britain is managed and landscaped through multi-layered socio-cultural legacies of which are amplified through the scarcity of the island land conveying monetary cultural attitudes and power and therefore celebrating it. The essays interpretation of the British landscape as a constructed land informs and justifies my works contextual narrative of managed and non-managed space.
Wells enforcing landscape as a social construct:

Representation of land as landscape, whether in romantic or in more topographic modes, reflects and reinforces contemporary political, social and environmental attitudes.” (Wells, 2011, p. 1)
Landscape is a social product; particular landscapes tell us something about cultural histories and attitudes. Landscape results from human intervention to shape or transform natural phenomena, of which we are simultaneously a part. A basic useful definition of landscape thus would be vistas encompassing both nature and the changes that humans have effected on the natural world. (Wells, 2011, pp. 1–2)

On the notion of ‘space’ and ‘place’ Wells notes that history turns one into the other:

History turns space into place. This simple statement masks a complexity of ideological processes associated with the relation of humankind and our environment. (Wells, 2011, p. 19)

Wells states that landscape images are representations but also responses to space:

Landscape pictures thus centrally contribute to the representation of space as place and, crucially, imply responses to particular places. (Wells, 2011, p. 25)

Notes

“a conceptual framework consisting of four factors: (1) qualities of the space; (2) types of activity; (3) time and duration of activities; and (4) originator of the activity.” (Franck, 2013, p. 154)

Franck focuses on activities carried out within the space:

“Activities, not only spaces, are prominent in the framework I have outlined, for it is through their actions that people produce a space, often regardless of its name or intended purposes” (Franck, 2013, p. 168)

Franck singles out the wild and overgrown for signs of abandonment:

“Whether the sites are empty buildings, remnants of buildings, empty land, or some combination, they are frequently derelict and deteriorated, possibly wild and overgrown. The wildness, the strange configurations of building remnants and overgrown trees and plants and mysterious clues to past uses all make such sites extremely interesting to explore” (Franck, 2013, p. 154)

Terrain vague space is unoccupied and free like many public spaces:

“Curiously enough, this is a quality of most traditional public spaces as well: sidewalks, squares, and parks are highly accessible and easily appropriated for activities they were not intended to accommodate, activities that may then be contested by the authorities.” (Franck, 2013, p. 156)

Some public spaces do not have any uses:

“Some leftover public spaces, often next to transit routes or at the edges of bodies of water, have no intended use whatsoever, being then even emptier and more available for appropriation than other public spaces” 

Terrain vague spaces “exist outside the city’s effective circuits and productive structures”:

“This marginality could be geographic, economic, social, or temporal. Abandoned industrial sites may be geographically remote from the current everyday life of the city and not easily visible or controllable. They may also be socially and economically marginal, as they are remote from daily life and produce no revenue.” (Franck, 2013, p. 157)

                Psychogeography /  by Erika Owen. 
A short lifestyle guide to a subject associated with historic Parisian men in top hats or the contemporary psychogeographer stereotype of a white male with walking boots, shorts and hiking bag prowling urban spaces. The author sidesteps esotericism and repackages the flaneur pursuit as a laid back hygge-equivalent lifestyle to aid wellbeing. 
Flaneurism as a lifestyle is not an outlandish proposal. Think back to when Instagram was fun and engaging. I know it was a long time ago, but content synonymous with the [[Flâneur]] like food, drink and travel was popular. The app at one time seemed like a plug for a spontaneous-engaging lifestyle. A more relevant simile is the conventional and contemporary domestic tourist navigating the city by foot from tourist attraction to hospitality.

Beginner tips: 

Have good shoes.
Break. 
Be playful -fight boredom.
Journal
Research new spaces

Creative:

Put a line or circle through a map. Follow it.
Trade walking journals.

Feminist interpretation:

The 19th-century flaneur: "drunken, syphilitic men wandering around and allowing themselves to find romanticism or excitement or perversity."
Lack of acknowledged historic and contemporary female flaneurs. 
Walking is freedom. No delays, no traffic, more personal space. Bypass designated travel methods and zones for your own route.
Book: Flaneuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice and London by Lauren Elkin
Elkin: ...tune in to your surroundings, no matter what they are, urban or not. And no matter who you are, just look around you and ask, "How is this world put together?" "How is it made easier for some people to navigate than others?" "What is my responsibility in this place where I spend every day, how am I a part of it, and how do I affect other people's experiences of it?"

Health:

Urban nature reduces stress

Outside of France :

Italy: passeggiata -an after-dinner stroll.
Australia: the walkabout.
Germany: geocaching remains popular.
The UK
Roamers (?) are a British equivalent, wandering and appreciating tiny details. Does the author mean Ramblers? Perhaps urban or radical ramblers.

Notes on stinkhorns: starts its life cycle as an egg-like fungus, then leaves the ground as a phallus which smells like rotting meat. The aroma lures insects like blowflies to a surgery liquid laced with spores. The  spores piggyback on the fly to other areas like dung. It’s edible (but  why would you?) at the egg stage. Found in broadleaf and coniferous  woodlands. Sometimes I see them in late autumn within edgeland  plantations.

                Botany /  The corn poppy belongs in the field alongside other arable weeds and  cultivated grain crops. A single poppy can produce a thousand seeds.  These seeds lay dormant in the ground for decades, made permanent by the plough they churn into the earth dormant until the right conditions. 
This continual permanence provides its moniker: corn poppy. The significance of which is lost to chemical weedkillers. Like those  simplistic herbicide advertisements depicting a spray bottle killing a  dandelion till it wilts into nothing, herbicides also kill association. Religated from field to leftover spaces, its contemporary moniker is now the common poppy.  
The construction of the new housing estate - the removal of the  agricultural topsoil and further levelling of the earth has created an  abundance of poppies. Their dormant resilience to human disruption,  construction or destruction, is their significant defining  characteristic besides their colour.
There probably isn't a weed  more appropriated in terms of imagery than the poppy. Early  civilisations associated them with blood, a semiotic foundation  underpinning today's cultural interpretation. Meanwhile, I wonder how  many dormant poppy seeds lay in wait underneath my garden topsoil as the remnants of historic agriculture.

grey willow (f) hybrid

Goat willow, which I assumed to be a simple tree, is, in fact, several hybridized variations between goat (salix caprea) and grey (salix cinerea) willow -amongst others. I often encounter it within overlooked spaces, and  like many plants associated with weeds, I dismissed it as commonplace.  You can often find it as a deciduous shrub or modest scruffy tree  growing in a sheltered and damp space. 
I have a female hybrid  willow in my garden. As tall as the house and leaning into the lawn, I  often contemplate cutting it down. The times I've almost fallen out of  it when attempting to prune its limbs extending over the neighbours  fencing. 
On occasion, I've whittled spoons out of off-cuts. The  prepared wood is bone white, saturated with water and easy to work with  when wiped with a cloth. The worked wood gradually turns off white with  cooking and eating, obtaining a coffee-coloured patina. It's a practical softwood suitable for coppicing, fast-growing as a living hedge, and  lauded by insect pollinators in spring. For all its benefits, I still  associate it with wasteland.
Despite there being 400+ species under the willow/Salix genus, the word willow brings to mind the ornamental weeping willow. As a cultivated tree, it is  found in urban parks and estate grounds. Its long branches drape over  lawns, paths and waterways. This familiar landscape feature is a  naturalised Chinese species, introduced into Britain and hybridized with the native white willow. 
Before the cultural disregard, the goat willow once held religious associations for use on Palm Sunday. Its male trees, which produce attractive yellow catkins, were sought  after as an alternative to palms used in processions. This tradition is  redundant becoming frowned upon by early modern Britain. This book of  the Kew series of Natural History from the 1950s uses negative  connotations to describe the practice: hordes of trippers, ramblers and gypsies.

The fostered weeping willow is coveted while the native goat/grey willow is neglected within cultural memory. Its religious appropriation is  retired, while it also lacks horticultural ornamental fancy and a  monetary value as lumber. Symbolic then that it now resides within  informal wildlife-focused gardens, nature reserves and leftover spaces.
From an environmental perspective, both goat and grey willow are undervalued native species that provide an early food source for early pollinators in turn contributing a habitat for foraging birds. Fortunate then there is a female goat willow on my patch of edgelands located by a road  drainage ditch. Like the willow in my garden, it could be a hybrid but  it resembles the darker hairy branches of the goat willow. 
This  specimen is weed-like with a crowded crown of stems vying for space with the dominant hawthorn and blackthorn. Though well established the  willow is singular, with no others in the area. Deer and rabbit are  partial to willow saplings, both of which are in the area and could  damage exposed willow saplings.

As a weed: Jack-by-the-hedge thrives in the sheltered margins of hedgerows. Urban environments can provide the same, if not similar, shelter. Consequently, like the weeds discussed in last weeks issue 015, it has an invasive characteristic and is found on brownfield wastelands and car parks.

                Botany /  The surreal mundane familiarity of the roadside layby ends with a stride into the adjacent woodland. Among last year's leaf fall, the floor is populated by wild garlic. Their pungent leaves, elongated and pointing to the forest floor, paint the spring woodland in a fresh green. Its Latin designation, Allium uranium, ursus referring to bears attributing to its other name bear garlic, suggests that brown bears would enjoy this place. With none in sight, we collect some, using them throughout the week for pesto, cheese scones, and lasagne. It differs from conventional garlic, I find that it has a warm chive taste. Given its uncultivated and brief availability, it signifies spring.

                Film /  Notes on Tarkovsky’s 1979 science fiction movie, Stalker, and [[Terrain vague]].

In Stalker, {terrain vague} becomes the material embodiment of an idea—that the world around us is, ultimately, the world we think into existence and, at the same time, the world that inhabits us. What is magical in this version of terrain vague (which, as Solà-Morales suggests, is indeed “evocative”—it “calls forth”) is that people bring their world into being, so that terrain vague, in its productive indeterminacy, becomes a tangible manifestation of an otherwise suppressed or forgotten dialogue between the human being and the physical environment.

                Film /  Notes on Alex Garland’s 2018 science fiction movie, Annihilation, and [[Terrain vague]].


Alex Garland’s 2018 science fiction movie, Annihilation, features an alien entity which transforms organic material in a zone called the shimmer. The shimmer  concept is similar to Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 movie, Stalker, in which a departed alien entity has transformed corridors of space subjected to unknown extra-terrestrial laws called the Zone. 


Like Tarkovsky’s Zone, Garlands’ Shimmer  is a [[terrain vague]] territory, one that is visually post-apocalyptic and rewilded, however, due to the extra-terrestrial, nature constantly distorts and evolves. This constant change is also applied to the characters as Garland explores, metaphorically and visually, existential crises, terminal disease, relationships and trauma through the journey in the [[Terrain vague]] landscape. 


On the surface the film is a straightforward extra-terrestrial action horror, however, Garland, like Tarkovsky, uses the concept of [[Terrain vague]] as an uncertain representational space as a metaphorical landscape, one that reflects the protagonist and characters. The shimmer's mutating DNA plot device echoes the ambiguous terrain vague with the characters themselves becoming uncertain of who or what they are. Subtle physical attributes and traumatic experiences are shared between the characters.


The four supporting characters succumb to the shimmer. Two are absorbed into the physical environment. In the final, the protagonist questions who they are and if they are still themselves. The existential question is at the core of the film through the terrain vague metaphor, land is representational -it reflects ourselves, culturally and socially. The shimmer and the zone are metaphorical landscape devices open to interpretation just as there many interpretations of both films.

Daubenton kale
Originating from France, it is named after French naturalist Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton. 
Has variations. One of which is variegated (marks and patches of different colours).

Nine star
Broccoli-cauliflower but often grouped into perennial kale. Produces heads. Some argue its not a true perennial. Mostly grown in the states.
Couve Galega
A tall Portuguese kale. 
Used to make Portuguese caldo verde soup.
Resistant to cold. ONLY a perennial in cold climates. I'm doubtful this would include the UK, what with its hot summers. Cuttings have to be taken for a constant supply.
I bought some seed from ebay. Unlike [[seakale]] they germinated with ease, and at the time of writing they are surviving early autumnal weather.

Seakale
[[Seakale]] grows along European shorelines. I have seen it on beaches, but never paid it any attention.

The start. I receive seeds, they go straight into pots and under grow lights where they will live till next spring. Sceptical, I wait for germination. From what I gather they are difficult to germinate. 


7/9/2021
All the seeds failed to germinate. Some time in late August I restart-rethink. I try two methods: (1) soaking seeds in salt water for 24hours, and (2) sowing seeds in sand and leaving them outside under the porch. 
The second method results in one successful germination. This is repotted in compost/sand, brought inside and placed under lights. The seeds need a period of cold stratification? 


22/9/2021
The seakale seedling has developed a leaf. It lives in a ikea socker greenhouse. I use a spray to keep the humidity up.

                Landscape /  Through the lack of context and their subversive edgy characteristics, edgeland sites can harbour suspicion. These are out of town areas where the socially marginal meet for questionable or immoral activities.  These dystopias are enforced and exploited through film and tv.  Throughout the 1990's the backdrop of the indie crime movie was an  edgeland site. The place where money is exchanged, money is stolen, and the criminal-protagonist cover is walking the dog. Of course, the edginess is hyperbole, visually enhanced with banal  industrial architecture, debris and monotonous colour balances. Film  portrays them as landscapes where concluding conflict is played out. In  reality, these areas, besides the occasional glimpses of marginal  society (the attempted dog theft) spurring suspicion, are not  straightforward dystopias but banal urban peripheries with complex  social processes. 
Author of the term:

The aura of excitement which goes with the apparent lawlessness of the edgelands has been exploited in such films of the 1990s as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Things to Do in Denver When you’re Dead, Fargo and The Straight Story. (Shoard, 2000, p. 130)

[[Roberts, M. S.]] co-author of edgelands Journeys Into England's True Wilderness (2011):

Marion Shoard’s coining of ‘edgelands’ seemed to conjure exactly our experience of these places. They were, and are, edgy. In British tv drama and low budget films, the edgelands are always the place of the dénouement, the place where the drug gang is busted, the car chase ends, or the kidnap victim is rescued. These are places where anything could happen. And when it did, it was usually illegal or contravened every rule of health and safety. This sense of the edgelands as a dystopian landscape is a familiar trope of British popular culture in particular. (Roberts, 2016, pp. 19–20)

Terminology

Naming turns space into place (Wells, 2011, p. 3).



[[Edgelands]] - indeterminate interfacial between urban and rural. 


[[Urban Wildscape]] - urban spaces under the agency of nature.


[[Third landscape]] - spaces left to natural evolution.


[[Non-place]]  - contemporary urban spaces without history.


[[Terrain vague]]  - imprecise spaces.


Avoiding the predetermined
As a " " landscape photographer " " I constantly need reminding, that despite the above definitions, landscape is a “highly differentiated discourse on representing space” (Bate, 2009, p. 93).
Following a unique interpretation of a site whether that is through geography, autobiography, or metaphor, will create original work and avoid cliche.

                Landscape /  French landscape theoretical term for indeterminate space, defined by Spanish architect, Ignasi de Solà- Morales, stating:

It is impossible to capture in a single English word or phrase the meaning of terrain vague. The French term terrain connotes a more urban quality than the English land; thus terrain is an extension of the precisely limited ground fit for construction, for the city.” (de Solà- Morales, 2013, p. 26).

Breaking down the etymology

The term has duality stemming from Latin: “Vague descends from vacuus, giving us “vacant” and “vacuum” in English, which is to say “empty, unoccupied,” yet also “free, available, unengaged.”  
A second meaning superimposed on the French vague derives from the Latin vagus, giving “vague” in English, too, in the sense of “indeterminate, imprecise, blurred, uncertain.” (de Solà- Morales, 2013, p. 26). 
Solà- Morales uses the french term ‘terrain vague’ because the English vocabulary for these pockets of vacant landscape have negative connotations such as wasteland.

My favourite explanation
Stanka Radović has a clear definition in the essay ‘on the threshold’ - an essay using the Andrei Tarkovsky 1979 film, Stalker, to explore the term as a utopia:

“... terrain vague escapes and challenges rigid definitions. Is it urban or is it natural? Is it a concept or a concrete place? Free or forlorn? The term “terrain vague” translates into English as “wasteland,” “derelict area,” or “vacant land,” and refers to abandoned or unoccupied portions of urban land that remain available for spontaneous use.” (Radović, 2013, p. 114)

Before de Solà- Morales, Man Ray, inspired by Eugène Atget, captioned these photographs 'Terrain Vague'.

                Landscape /  ( Tiers-Paysage )
A term for les délaissés (leftover spaces of urban development) for nature to colonise. Coined by Gilles Clément, a French garden designer, botanist, entomologist and writer, in a manifesto entitled ‘Manifeste du Tiers paysage’.
In ‘Manifeste du Tiers paysage’, Clément argues that neglected and unexploited space is a reserve under the term third landscape. Left to evolution, biological processes and agency transform anthropized territories to natural spaces which provide biodiverse habitats for fauna and flora but can also be used by society as spaces for leisure and connection to the natural world.

The term can refer to:


the indeterminate urban boundary between rural territories which can host infrastructure, golf courses, car parks and canals.


marginal areas outside of conventional urban circuits like derelict and brownfield sites.


non-places such as retail parks, service stations and transport infrastructure on the outskirts

… the conservation movement, while well intentioned, has sought to freeze living systems in time. It attempts to prevent animals and plants from either leaving or–if they do not live there already–entering. It seeks to manage nature as if tending a garden. Many of the ecosystems, such as heath and moorland, blanket bog and rough grass, that it tries to preserve are dominated by the low, scrubby vegetation which remains after forests have been repeatedly cleared and burnt.  This vegetation is cherished by wildlife groups, which prevent it from reverting to woodland through intensive grazing by sheep, cattle and horses. It is as if conservationists in the Amazon had decided to protect the cattle ranches, rather than the rainforest.  (Monbiot, 2014, p. 8)

Management of moorland through cutting. 



Out of 218 nations, the UK ranks 189th for the intactness of its living systems (rspb, 2016)
… In Britain, as in most of Western Europe, land is managed; it follows that vistas or landscapes are constructed, which means that a sense of aesthetic principles, as well as social mores, are in play. (Wells, 2011, p. 28)

                Landscape /  
E. M. Forster in 1964 wrote that two world wars had enveloped the wildness of Britain. “‘Two great wars demanded and bequeathed regimentation,’ wrote E. M. Forster in 1964, ‘science lent her aid, and the wildness of these islands, never extensive, was stamped upon and built over and patrolled in no time. There is no forest or fell to escape to today, no cave in which to curl up, and no deserted valley.’” (Macfarlane 2009, p.8)

Jonathan Raban claims Britain lost its wilderness much earlier in the 1860s with population and industry:

so thickly peopled, so intensively farmed, so industrialised, so citified, that there was nowhere to go to be truly alone, or to have … adventures, except to sea. (Jonathan Raban Cited in (Macfarlane 2009, p.8))

Macfarlane states population and the road network is really to blame for the lack of wilderness or remoteness:

In Britain, over sixty-one million people now live in 93,000 square miles of land. Remoteness has been almost abolished, and the main agents of that abolition have been the car and the road. Only a small and diminishing proportion of terrain is now more than five miles from a motorable surface. There are nearly thirty million cars in use in Britain, and 210,000 miles of road on the mainland alone. (Macfarlane 2009, p.9)

George Monbiot argues that there is a wildness paradox, that Britain's gardens have more wildlife in them than barren uplands:

Spend two hours sitting in a bushy suburban garden anywhere in Britain, and you are likely to see more birds, and of a wider range of species, than you would while walking five miles across almost any open landscape in the uplands. (Monbiot 2014, p.69)

Liz Wells argues Britain is a managed land and notes the paradox of the pictorial countryside as safe, clean, and undisturbed rather than managed.

...British land is managed – there is no wilderness; even the coastal littoral is overseen (by the Environment Agency). It follows that landscapes and vistas are human constructs, which means that aesthetic principles, as well as social mores, were and are in play within the actual shaping of land. Pictorial renderings of countryside as pastoral depict Britain as undisturbed and undisturbing, thus contributing to constructing a simplified and benign rural imaginary, to picturing countryside as safe. (Wells 2011, p.164)

The lack of wild animals like wolves, beaver and boar:

So few wild creatures, relatively, remain in Britain and Ireland: so few, relatively, in the world. Pursuing our project of civilisation, we have pushed thousands of species towards the brink of disappearance, and many thousands more over that edge. The loss, after it is theirs, is ours. Wild animals, like wild places, are invaluable to us precisely because they are not us. They are uncompromisingly different. (Macfarlane 2009, p.306,307)

📝 The following is a mini essay / artist statement  for Snag / Inflorescence - a project conducted during my masters in photography.


This project is about borders. Specifically, marginal urban spaces which are informal and unmapped sites of transition. 
[[Marginal space]] denotes a territory which exists on an edge or margin of an interface. Often the consequence of abandonment as well as the by-product of urban development and the intermittent economic tide on which it is determined by, these unproductive spaces are situated between others. Due to their segregated interstice nature, they are territories which fall outside of the conventional urban circuit. 
Disconnection from the productive urban interface induces negative connotations which emphasize wastefulness such as “wasteland” or “derelict land”. Additionally, numerous anthropological terms can be used to describe and interpret marginal spaces, sometimes categorizing them as concrete places between urban and rural interfaces. The etymological processes and historic scrutinization across different disciplines demonstrate the fluidity of the space and its countless interpretations.
The work avoids subscribing to any one definition or spatial connotation. Instead, it focuses on ambivalence and inexactness. Our reading of landscape is informed by a cultural construction of urban and rural, and furthermore civilization and nature. I am interested in the uncertain responses when these constructs fail us. Within photography, this is a long-established method and approach to marginal spaces.
Parisian Eugène Atget captured a ‘zone’ of empty and neglected spaces encompassing Paris in a work titled Zoniers in 1913 (Carville, 2018, p. 255). Following Atget, surrealist, Man Ray, made photographs of a vacant lot in Paris, titled Terrain Vague, which would later inspire the modern term of the same name.
Man Ray’s, Terrain Vague, as seen in Fig 1, is an influential image to the project. Though taken in 1932, it features no obvious landmarks or discerning features resulting in a timeless appearance that could be geographically anywhere. Discarded ironwork remains lay on a footprint covered embankment while a featureless tree cuts through the foreground. The scene is uncertain and apprehensive.

Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 film, Stalker, is a conceptual influence. It uses the concept of marginal space, its uncertainty and unease, as a science fiction narrative plot device known as the Zone. Alex Garland’s homage, the 2018 film, Annihilation, draws from similar narratives and devices by using marginal space as fluid and dreamlike landscape. Both works are examples of using indeterminate space for storytelling.
With these influences, I began to explore and search for my own Zone. A historic road turned field border provided discourse on successional nature reclaiming human spaces and our interaction with them. Conifer plantations, long narrow strips of woodland that are often seen on the edges of golf courses and agricultural fields on the fringes of urban encroachment, presented a human vision of nature in uniformed repetitious spacings. Post-industrial wasteland demonstrated the banality of urban space and its economic ties. Within these spaces, the photographic act, through framing and composition, conveyed a myriad of pre-defined interpretations. 
Photographic representations of marginal space can, through aesthetics and mediated focus, align with already established interpretations. This is a trap which fails to engage with the space and enforces modish spatial connotations resulting in stale urban imagery. 
Following Tarkovsky’s conceptual influence -the use of marginal spaces as a source of functional indeterminacy and unique interpretations, I sought a unique photographic representation of marginal space. I chose a site that I am knowledgeable of and have an autobiographical connection with. The site is a neglected allotment plot. Situated out of the way in an overlooked corner of dense bramble, roses and dilapidated greenhouses, I have personal ties to this space. My grandparents took it over in the late ’1950s when they moved into the red brick terrace of three overlooking the plot. It is not a conventional allotment plot, more an extension of the house and a part of the family landscape. 
The site has been the subject of constant landscaping through the working of the land for more than fifty years by the same group of people. Their history through their actions is in the land itself. Anthropologist, Tim Ingold, refers to this as a woven texture which is incorporated into plants and animals:

Human beings do not, in their movements, inscribe their life histories upon the surface of nature as do writers upon the page; rather, these histories are woven, along with the life-cycles of plants and animals, into the texture of the surface itself (Ingold, 2000, p. 198).

This weaving of history is evident through the site's rose bushes. My grandfather prolifically hybridized his favourite rose varieties. Planted in borders, they once lined patches of vegetables and grass pathways. With neglect, they are now scattered like islands, thick with bramble climbing their stems and nettles crowding between. 
The roses can be interpreted as living ruins. Historic pruning, in the form of weathered snags and amputated stems, is evidence of a custodian applying shape and form to the plants. With neglect, these plants have now outgrown their intended forms with uncontrolled sporadic growth. 
Fig 2. Nettle and rose (Calow, 2020).

The notion of uncontrolled nature is furthered by the presence of self-seeding and opportunistic plants commonly known as weeds. These are left unchecked to fulfil their biological processes, living alongside the cultivated plants which are more suited to the romantic notions of the English rose garden. Together, the two create ambivalence and uncertainty as seen in fig 2. Is it a garden or a post-garden space turned feral? The question raises the marginal status of the space. Rather than answering the question, the project plays with the inquiry as a border between the two states.
In its intended form, the photobook, the sequenced images invite the viewer to question the space: its past through its evident horticultural legacy and its future as post-garden feral abandonment takes hold. The work is subjective with both sides of the narrative presented within the border construct, leaving the viewer to question the ambivalent scenes against their own spatial presumptions. Furthermore, by not adopting a relevant spatial connotation such as “[[urban wildscape]]” or “derelict land”, the work uses the inexact and transitional characteristic of [[marginal space]] as a narrative device, allowing the space to be open to interpretation. This conceptual play of imprecise spatial connotation and acknowledgement that humans live through the landscapes they inhabit, demonstrates a unique [[nature culture]] relationship: a transitional border between the garden and a new wilder space where the existing cultivated nature grows uncontrolled alongside opportunistic self-seeding nature.

                Essay /  Revised forward: Originally published on a blog after finishing a degree project in 2018. Preserved for demonstrating past methodologies/concepts. 

Foreword: this is a summary of a recent project that was undertaken as a final for a photography course. The article involves theory as well as practical elements. It is not a howto, but you are welcome to ask questions.


Surrealism has always courted accidents, welcomed the uninvited, flattered disorderly presences. What could be more surreal than an object which virtually produces itself, and with a minimum of effort? An object whose beauty, fantastic disclosures, emotional weight are likely to be further enhanced by any accidents that might befall it?¹ 

Toy cameras are surrealist tools. Their crude plastic bodies are housings for unsophisticated mechanisms, requiring little to no input by the user, effortlessly producing images with artefacts that prompt unexpected and spontaneous results.
Though I am not a Surrealist, these qualities that move beyond reality and predetermined modernism are attractive to me as a photographer. They serve as a reminder that ‘photography is not bound by any obligation to reality; like any other art, it is a set of resources which can be put to a variety of uses, and out of which a style can be forged’².
Shifting this surrealist unpredictability from the toy to the handmade camera is an exercise in problem solving by working within the basic parameters of photography. An understanding of the integral theories behind the photographic medium are applied to practical and physical attributes: a light tight box, a means to prepare the recording medium (sensor, film or plate), an operational shutter, and an aperture to allow light to enter the box.
Cameras are tools, a means of capturing a scene on to a photographic medium. It follows that the handmade camera is a customised and specialised tool to meet the individual photographer’s needs. Just as an artist may use a handmade brush, material or tool to create a unique look and style, a photographer looking to create a unique representation or interpretation can do so through the act of making the tool.
Seeking to explore the landscape of the British countryside with a surrealist undetermined nature, which underlines the toy camera and lo-fi imagery, took the form of a four month final major project building two cameras and shooting with them.
Camera one started life with the premise of creating a wooden toy camera. It is a simple box camera made from 3mm balsa wood, housing a roll of medium format, and a 6x6 mask. An Agfa compur-rapid shutter sits at the front, of which the original lens elements are replaced with a meniscus element suitable for a 21mm focal length. The original plan was to implement a viewfinder, however the wide focal length made it easy to compose with. To load the camera, the top plate comes off, and film can be slid inside, similar to the Leica cameras.

The camera, rushed in design and construction to meet deadlines, suffers from fundamental issues and faults. One major flaw is that the lens barrel on the shutter is too long for the wide focal length, creating a deep vignetting and a frame size closer to a 4x4 rather than a 6x6. With the wide focal length, the original aperture markings became invalid as the f32 became an f8. The narrowest aperture of f8 meant that distortions were not tamed enough and the resulting images, can in some cases, have distracting artefacts. A curved film plane, like that of the fujipet toy camera, was later added to diminish a curvature distortion. During the time using the camera, a minimalist centre focused composition was adopted to take advantage of the sharp centre and blurred distorted edges.
The benefit of adapting a shutter to the camera body allowed for relatively accurate and controlled exposure timings. The slow shutter speeds on the compur-rapid shutter allowed for the capture of movement, which was used to capture waterfalls.


The fastest shutter speed, a respectable 1/400th of second, allowed for the capture of a snow covered landscape in bright conditions. The low contrast of the below image was created by a pull development process as a high speed film was accidentally loaded into the camera when a slow film was needed. Rather than scrapping the film, it was decided, in Sontag's words, to court the accident. The unusual diamond shape and uneven exposure could be the result of cold temperatures making the shutter sticky.


The outcomes of the camera are interesting however, the images lack the surrealist spontaneity that the toy camera has. The shutter, with its range of speeds, insinuated a preference for perfection. Toy cameras have little to no options in the way of control, let alone shutter speeds. This is where camera two came in.
Camera two is a TLR camera made from a wooden box and a balsa insert box. A modified Holga shutter and a 50mm convex lens intended for science experiments are the basic photographic elements, while a mirror, fogged perspex, and an identical lens were used to create a rudimentary viewfinder. These devices were almost entirely housed within the insert box, while the main, larger, box housed the film and winding mechanism.
diy tlr camera

Camera two is not a work of art, it was constructed in a toy camera fashion -a rushed and slapdash manner so that a lo-fi look could be achieved from the beginning. In the way of mechanisms, it is possible to focus the camera by moving the insert-able box back and forth, however with a fixed aperture of f8, any immediate subjects are in clear focus making the need to focus redundant. This is nothing new in the realm of the toy camera as Holga and Lomography photographers are known to forget the focus and just shoot.
With a fixed f stop and shutter speed, results became more comparable to lo-fi with surreal results beyond that of the toy camera. Below is a pictorial pastoral scene which is similar in tone to George Davison's onion field. The blurriness is similar to that of the pinhole camera, without the long exposure times.


Below, is another another murky-painterly pastoral scene with just enough clarity to make out the immediate path and its details.


The light leaks and jagged edges come from a cardboard mask which was modified and experimented with over time. These artefacts were more prominent in bright conditions and subdued with tape and black matte paint.
The uncoated simple lens produces a low contrast that complements dense fog and defused light.


The lines in the below image are caused by the cardboard mask becoming too coarse and scratching the film as it travels along. It adds a texture that is eerie and horror film like. In most cases the scratches are hard to see.


In bright conditions, the uncoated simple lens performs well enough for the intended purpose. The below image is absent of flares and has enough contrast to produce a stark depiction of a single tree.


All of the negatives were scanned and processed digitally. The darkroom could have provided further alternative processes, enough for a whole other project. Deadlines meant I could not pursue this. The post processing attributes applied -slightly burning in vignetting and adjustments to contrast, would be applied in the darkroom.
Conclusions drawn from this project
Intending to explore the landscape with a surrealist lo-fi undertone has resulted in processes at the fundamental level of photography. The basic tools created to produce the outcomes could have taken many forms in varying mediums. The choice of medium format as a recording medium seemed natural given that the majority of toy cameras use it. Medium format is also used by British landscape photographers, Micheal Kenna and Fay Godwin, of whom are personal influences and heroes of mine. Additionally, though the project was not about perfection, it could have been achieved, if desired, by mounting a medium or large format lens. The cameras built for the project were successful for the purposes of looking beyond the toy camera and exploring the broader fundamental attributes of photography.
The pursuit of capturing the landscape with a simple camera over traditional and conventional equipment is synonymous with Edward Weston's statement that 'richness of control facilities often acts as a barrier to creative work' and that 'the task can be made immeasurably easier by selecting the simplest possible equipment and procedures and staying with them'³. Photographers can be addicted to the pursuit and acquisition of equipment rather than the photograph and message they wish to convey. I am guilty of this at times -the zeal of shiny brass Leica. Using a simple camera, whether a toy, pinhole or handmade camera, removes the focus from equipment and to the creative semiotics and message.
The landscape photographs in this project, and others such as my Holga work covering the Peak District, are people-less, sublime, and unsentimental. Non-photographers will often use the word moody to describe the work, identifying the sublime visual signifiers as dark, eerie, and bleak. I see the work as a reminder that under the façade of the social construct: British countryside being a picturesque idyllic tidy garden, there lies a wilderness under layers of centuries old management and manipulation of the land.

                Essay /  An essay about Fay Godwin and the British landscape, written during my degree in 2017.
The notion of ‘Landscape’ in Britain implores images of coastlines, rivers, canals, fields, moorland, hills, mountains, villages and gardens. Though broad in scope, these designations and types of environment are far away from the notion of ‘wilderness’. Like the extinct wolves and lynxes which were indigenous to the British isles so to has the swathes of untouched forest and moorland become extinct, carved up, transformed and managed. The entire land and sea is managed, creating a link between the British landscape and the idea of land ownership. The British ‘countryside’ is a social construct of history, privilege, and ownership with hedges, fences and stonewalls carving up the land, whilst castles to village cottages lay claim to land. Pictorial British landscapes only enforce this idea of ownership, as Berger suggests ‘To have a thing painted and put on a canvas is not unlike buying it and putting it in your house. If you buy a painting you also buy the look of the thing it represents’ (Berger, 2008, p. 83). Furthermore the British pastoral countryside, through land management and its association of ownership, is often depicted as a safe rural idyll regardless of recent hardships such as floods and culling of diseased animals. (Wells, 2011, p. 164).
A photographer that explored the British landscape and the subsequent countryside social construct was Fay Godwin. Godwin was active from the mid 70’s to the early 1990’s with the most famous work being in the accessible printed form of books namely ‘Land’, 1985, and ‘Our Forbidden land’ printed in 1990. Both books, with their different agendas, offer the viewer an insight into the British landscape at the end of the 20th century and are the subject of this essay.
Land
‘Land’ consists of 127 black and white images of Godwin’s work spread over 10 years within the landscape genre. The majority of ‘Land’ falls within a traditional romanticist view of the landscape, similar in tone to archetype British landscape painters Gainsborough, Constable and Turner. This aesthetic presents the countryside as the traditional pastoral scene and the rural idyll, but with a modernist focus on form and a photographic authority of authenticity and realism. Although the photographs are presented in this straightforward traditional aesthetic often associated with the unrealistic romanticist vision, Godwin strives for realism by avoiding picturesque imagery. On ‘the south bank show’ (1986) Godwin suggested a wariness of picturesque pictures commonly seen in commercial landscape photography such as that on postcards arguing that they were sentimental and idealistic, presenting the countryside in an unrealistic way (appendix A). Instead, Godwin was interested in the immediate scene explaining ‘I’m quite often frightened out in the landscape, and it’s often quite simply indifferent, and I’m interested all those different aspects’ (Godwin, 1986, pt. 1:27). These aspects are asserted in the organisation and order of the work with the book starting off in grandeur with impressionistic dark contrasting images of the Scottish highlands before turning to topography studies of ancient stones, farm buildings and rural pastoral land. However towards the end of the work there is an encroaching antagonism and disharmony with industry, power stations, and debris making appearances which Godwin uses to comment on environmental issues as if foreshadowing Godwin's follow up book.
Analysis and Technical break down
‘Land’ is a broad study of British landscape featuring minimalism, juxtaposition, topography, and abstract studies amongst traditional landscape scenes. Subjects range from ancient monuments, farmland, village scenes, coastlines, moorlands, and mountains.
The majority of images are square 1:1 ratio, while others are slightly wider 4:5 and even wider 2:3. These ratios relate to the fact that the entire work is shot with medium format. Godwin was never brand loyal to one particular camera manufacturer, but had a soft spot for the Swedish Hasselblad namely the 500cm which took square 6x6 images. Other cameras used by Godwin include a Plaubel Makina which took 6x7 images (4:5 ratio) and a Linhof for wider 6x9 images (2:3 ratio). Lenses ranged from a very wide 21mm, to a standard wide 35mm to a standard normal 50mm (see Appendix B for emails from Peter Cattrell, Godwin’s printer).
Composition traits and techniques follow the simple rule of thirds with subjects off centre and land taking up three quarters of the frame. The use of symmetry, notably the square images, brings balance to scenes as seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2 where the horizon line splits the sky and mountains from the moorland heath, further emphasized by the burning of the land creating two contrasting halves. Another trait is having the camera close to the ground, setting the viewer within the environment rather than looking down at it, this can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Figure 1. Glencoe from Lochan na Fola (Godwin, 1985, p. 3)

    Figure 2. Four trees, Rannoch Moor (Godwin, 1985, p. 16)

Juxtaposition as a pictorial visual device is used adjacent with topographic elements creating a contrast of time, history and physical attributes of artificial and natural elements. This can be seen in Figure 3 whereby Godwin uses a traditional pastoral emblem, the humble hay bale against the ancient stones. The cylindrical bale contrasts against the straight lines of the ancient stones, appearing modern and out of place yet here they both exist. This tension and questioning between both elements is enhanced with the looming dark skies which look to have been complemented with burning during printing. 
A similar, more subtle, use of juxtaposition is seen in Figure 4. Godwin has used an ancient marker stone to playfully imitate the angle of the stone wall top left and also to connect with the wall at the top of the marker. The burning of the marker shadow and the adjacent rock ultimately creates a zigzag through the entire image hinting the notion of carved up and managed land.
Despite the images in Figure 3 and Figure 4 being of areas of agricultural land, more so in Figure 3 though Figure 4 could have livestock on the land, there are no people. This is a trait throughout the work. There are traces of people -paths, villages, churches, but never the rural people themselves. This emptiness and loneliness is a key theme to the work, it enables the work to be solely focused on the land.
Figure 3. Stones of Stenness, Orkney

Figure 4. Marker stone, Old Harlech to London Road, Wales (Godwin, 1985, p. 69)

Godwin has a tendency to fill the frame, getting the most out of the substantial negative size provided by medium format. By keeping cropping to a minimum at the printing stage (see Appendix B for emails from Peter Cattrell, Godwin’s printer), and by using all of the frame in terms of composition, composing completely in camera, the images have a consistency. This can be seen in Figure 5 whereby Godwin has chosen to embrace the environment and negative space surrounding the subject rather than cropping.
As discussed before, towards the end of ‘land’, there is an antagonism and conflict with society environmentally impacting the British landscape and threatening its safe pastoral countryside. This can be seen directly with pollution as in Figure 5. Here Godwin uses perspective, whether intentionally or not, by looking down at a rotting car half submerged in water. Godwin rarely used this visual trait opting for an immersive low down but level horizon perspective as seen in previous Figures. By looking down at the car and the lagoon, they appear weaker and fragile, perhaps to suggest about the fragility of the environment itself or to show the scene itself is something to look down upon. 
Godwin also uses more subtle ways to introduce environmental issues into the work with visual metaphors such as Figure 6. A solitary broken bench looks out to sea, whilst an oil rig appears behind the rock formations as if to say the view is as broken as the bench. These environmental issues and related themes are explored further in Godwin’s follow up printed work.

  Figure 6. Lerwick, Shetland (Godwin, 1985, p. 121)

Our forbidden land
Following ‘Land’, ‘Our forbidden land’, printed in 1990, features 188 plates and a number of supporting images. The first image in the book as seen in Figure 7 epitomises the theme and voice of the work- a submerged public footpath sign amongst reeds. It echos the image of the rotting car in the previous Figure 5 with similar perspective. Additionally to the side, if the reader wasn’t clear about the message of this image, there are three contradictory quotes by the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher on the subject of the environment.
 Figure 7. Untitled (Godwin, 1990, p. 5)

Godwin’s political agenda is further voiced in the introduction written by herself, whereby revealing personal insights on copyright and restricted access to land, and discussing social environmental issues such as the use of pesticides and artificial fertilisers. This comes as Godwin, three years prior the publication of the work, was made president of the Ramblers Association, of which Godwin dedicates the book to. Being exposed to this political and active position, Godwin expresses concern for the conservative rural countryside, not just from contemporary society, but also from itself with ‘big business’ farmers using chemicals and exposing employees to poor working conditions.
In relation to photography, Godwin expresses concern about restrictions that present a legal minefield and potential headache for professional photographers.

‘It is extraordinary that Government agencies and others so often try to stop us photographing our heritage, our parks and gardens. They seem to think they can censor as well as try to copy-right the landscape and our heritage.’ (Godwin, 1990, p. 10)

This is particularly true for landscape photographers for example: the peak district, Britain's first national park, is 90% privately owned - only 17% of which is owned by the national trust and peak district national park authority with another 11% owned by water companies. So little of the land is actually free of copyright and is owned by many individual bodies rather than one collective. Understanding what is copyrighted and what is copyright free is commercially required and time consuming if the photographer has no local knowledge. (nationalgeographic.com, 2011). This introduction is supported by topographic images of signs displaying “dogs shot” and “keep out”. These range from farms, water companies and military installations. 
Analysis and Technical break down
There are several different types of genre photography featured in this work. While there are landscapes in the traditional pictorial form like those featured in ‘Land’, there are also documentary and photojournalism styled images. The phrase ‘political landscape’ comes close to describing the work. Godwin, expressing political beliefs through photography, moves from the modernist focus on form to a postmodern focus of scrutiny. 
Figure 8 is the selected cover image and effectively summarizes the work itself. A dominant snow covered Glencoe mountain is juxtaposed against the black tarmac of the road cutting through the landscape and disappearing into the mountain. Two white road markings in the form of arrows enforce the leading lines from the road and roadside fencing, pointing to the mountain. These directional elements indicate a conflict between the more natural rural countryside and progressive modernisation with its tarmac arteries.
Figure 9 is a photograph taken not far the peak district in Derbyshire. In the foreground, an excessive bold sign displaying various ‘Private land’ motifs is leaned against a low dry stone wall of which a sheep looks over and stares at Godwin. In the background is a vast pastoral scene complete with what looks like a tor and a small woodland. This image has humour with the watchful sheep, and irony that an excessive sign could be placed by such a low wall whilst showing the attitudes of the landowner to others. This image has a photojournalistic style while still retaining some of Godwin’s landscape traits such as the use of the rule of thirds.

Figure 9. Brassington, Derbyshire (Godwin, 1990, p. 99)

The previous images fit the characteristics of Godwin’s medium format practice, particularly the 6x7 format, however there are other formats in this work such as the use of 35mm. Lighter, more portable, and favourable to the spontaneous style of photojournalism, Godwin uses 35mm film as and when needed with a leica rangefinder. (see Appendix B for emails from Peter Cattrell, Godwin’s printer).
Figure 10 shows a spread within ‘our forbidden land’ from a series of images consisting of several pages exploring Cornwall. Here Godwin uses a photographic style akin to photojournalism through observation and non intervention, creating a narrative through sequential presentation of four images covering Lands end. Contrary to the loneliness of ‘Land’, Godwin captures people here to document Cornwalls tourism with an image of tourists photographing themselves by a Lands end signpost. Echoing Sontag’s statement: ‘Photographs will offer indisputable evidence that the trip was made, the program was carried out, that fun was had’ (Sontag, 2014, p. 9). By capturing the photographic act, Godwin shows the area is significant to tourists. The other images on the spread feature wildlife with a seagull sat amongst tourists at picnic tables, a miss framed in-flight seagull, and a bevy of swans in a model town showing Godwin’s humorous side. 
Figure 11 shows a spread under the title ‘Far too little access’ in which Godwin carries out, in a new topographic fashion, a topology study of estate signs in different forms. The left image is comparable to Lee Friedlander’s shadow images with Godwin’s use of shadow as a protagonist confronting the private sign being a subjective comment on restrictions to land (Sharpe, 2017, p. 268).
Figure 10. Cornwall Spread (Godwin, 1990, pp. 92–93)

Figure 11. ‘Far too little access’ (Godwin, 1990, pp. 64–65)

Through the use of the 35mm format, Godwin not only explores tourism, wildlife and topology but also society's connection to the countryside by covering rural food festivals, reclaimed urban land, farm oriented theme parks, and exploring public farms as seen in Figure 12. These images support the cultural construct of the countryside being a safe place whilst also showing the general public's exposure to rural environments that are fabricated and child safe. Godwin chooses to take a positive stance by photographing children interacting with animals. The spread in Figure 12 features 3 images of children. 
These 35mm film photojournalism images tend to be shot with a 35mm focal length lens, with which Godwin uses to place the subject within a surrounding environment creating an environmental portraiture style. These supplement Godwin’s people less medium format images which focus more on form.
There are exceptions in the work where Godwin favours medium format for documentary orientated images that are not pictorial in nature, but sombre in tone. This could be down to Godwin only having a particular camera at that moment in time, or felt the scene was worthy of a bigger negative. The image in Figure 13 is an example of this. Godwin uses a 6x7 medium format camera to capture farm rubbish dwelling near a footpath. These types of images are a continuation of ‘Rotting car, Cliffe Lagoon’ (Figure 5) and are usually printed on a full page.

Conclusions
On the surface, ‘Land’ is a book of accessible fine art images, which anyone with a passion for the countryside or pictorial landscapes can enjoy. Underlining this is a challenge to formal romantic depictions of the countryside. It can be seen as a modernist study of landscape with the use of black and white film putting emphasis on the shape and tone (Wells, 2015, p. 334). Additionally the aesthetic choice of monochrome is a form abstraction and reaction against picturesque commercial landscape images with vivid unrealistic colours. Godwin critiques postcards on the ‘the south bank show’ stating “I find most British postcards absolutely revolting” (Godwin, 1986, pt. 4:04). Nevertheless, monochrome is a key aesthetic and homogeneous feature throughout both works. The modernist focus of form attributes an objective and unsympathetic presentation whilst tonal values such burning of clouds and land help Godwin express the character of the space itself whether that be indifference, intimidation, or admiration of beauty (see Appendix A for Godwin’s thoughts on aspects of landscape). It is this subtle expression of character that challengers the safe rural construct and sets Godwin's work aside from exaggerated picturesque images which embellish rather than capture. 
‘Our forbidden land’ turns the subtle expression of space through landscapes to a journalistic style critique of the British countryside. Through a postmodern scepticism, the work is critical of contemporary modern society but also rural inhabitants too. Godwin explores the countryside impartiality without bias for example, in the book, there are photographs of rubbish from farms and from urban visitors. This gave Godwin, a photographer that can masterfully capture a landscape to an extremely high standard, the incitement to photograph banal subjects like rubbish and debris. ‘Our forbidden land’ is broader than its predecessor with narrative driven photojournalism supplementing topography studies and political landscapes, making the work both ideology driven and artistic. 
Appendix A
Fay Godwin as quoted on The South Bank Show 1986 produced by Hilary Chadwick.
On aspects of the landscape:“In landscape there’s all sorts of things as far as I’m concerned. It is of course very beautiful in many ways but, that isn’t all that it is. I feel in many ways landscape can be quite threatening -I’m quite often frightened out in the landscape, and it’s often quite simply indifferent, and I’m interested all those different aspects.” (Godwin, 1986, pt. 1:27)
On the notion of picturesque:“I am kind of wary of picturesque pictures. I get sort of satiated with looking at postcards in local newsagents and at the sort of picture books that are on sale, many of which, don’t seem to bear much relation to my own experience of the place.” (Godwin, 1986, pt. 3:28)
"The problem for me about these picturesque pictures, which proliferate all over the place, they are a sort of blanket, they are almost like a very soft warm blanket of sentiment which covers everybody’s idea about the countryside. […] It idealises the countryside in a very unreal way” (Godwin, 1986, pt. 7:09)

                Hack /  termux-camera-to-kindle.sh
Inspired by Antony Cairns. This short script was a tiny side project during my COVID restricted masters in photography. With no access to a darkroom I experimented with obscure/misunderstood digital technologies for image-making. 
The aim is to demonstrate e-ink technology as a medium for reproduction and the act of repurposing a commercial artefact for unconventional means (in this case appropriating monochrome images -the more indeterminate and abstract the better). 


Originally a python script that called system commands, I rewrote the script in bash for less dependencies. 


Besides the novelty of the process, it allowed me to understand how reproduction works on the e-ink screen, its behaviour and limitations. I found that having a strong contrast applied to images worked best, this may be down to the e-ink screen being limited to 3bit Greyscale (8 shades) -some of the lighter shades of grey lack clarity and are lost to the grey screen. 
Kindle ereader as a means of image reproduction
To reproduce images on the Kindle, I purposefully chose vague and abstract subject matter playing with the metaphor of culture appropriating nature. These are scans of the Kindle and image.   






Reflection
This started as a unconventional experiment during the pandemic quarantine, one that approaches {nature-culture} theme from a different approach. The more I reflect on it, the less unreasonable it becomes. The act of repurposing cultural artefact for another purpose is a subversive act, mimicking an aspect of the core theme. Additionally it offers discourse on cultural/digital appropriation of nature.

The sensor is hidden behind shielding. Remove it by unscrewing the surrounding screws.


Behind the shielding is the CCD sensor held in place with three screws.


Unscrew the three screws and lift gently. Remove the IR filter found underneath the sensor. The camera is probably dirty, so it may need a clean with air.

My process right now: I take two prints and tape them at the back  creating a simple book signature. I then double sticky tape one end to  the back of another signature. And repeat. To make it even stronger:  glue and tape the spine. 
For this experiment, binding some  leftover prints: I made a hardcover out of spare cardboard and more  tape. The spine of the signatures and the hardcover is simply glued together. I made it all a little too tight, stopping the book from being a flat lay. It’s okay for the first try. To really finish it, it needs a cover. I hope to make more with mini-projects.

                Make /  Dark winter days have a left a blue void, creating a need toward a suitable light source for printing cyanotypes. 
Using google for the subject. You find terrible archived forums advocating repurposing UV tanning appliances/bulbs and a blather of pointless arguments on different lighting types. 
Setting this rubbish aside I found a small amount of more credible information via books as well as asking artists and friends. 
Wavelength of the light source is important. Many of the cheaper light sources are vague and questionable. The apparent magic number often seen is 365nm, while 405nm which is usually used for resin curing does not work, but given the obscurity of some products mileage may vary. 
I found a cheap set of LED UV bulbs with a wavelength of 365nm - 400nm. The wattage is 7W and takes around 2 hours to contact print with a desk lamp and negative. This seems to check out, with my friends 13w energy saving UV bulb taking one hour to expose. 
A basic setup with a desk lamp.

Things to do
Rig up two lights for faster exposure. This could be done with cheap pendent lights and a box. A lid could hold the lights in place allowing for consistent results. I could even use a smart extension plug to time the exposure. 
Figure out and dial in exposure. I need to work out a process for creating a suitable negative for cyanotype printing. This is normally done with a curves tool to limit the dynamic range.

                Make /  Using oil
Using this method preparing for the cyanotype process, but it is adaptable for others.
Basic process

Image is inverted and prepared for printing.
Generic standard 80gsm plane paper.
Printed with settings for plain paper, standard resolution and monochrome.
On the backside of the paper. Use generic spray cooking oil.
Spread with a brush. Repeat till even or satisfied with transparency -it doesn't take much oil till its transparent but results may vary on oil/paper.  
Ensure oil is spread well and dry or risk staining the paper during printing. 



Thoughts on process and outcomes

Not as sharp as transparency film.
Denser than transparency film. Exposure times are longer.
I normally expose transparency film for an hour in the shade for indirect light minimizing blurring.
Paper negatives needed around an hour and half in shade. 
Painterly imperfections - oil splodges had a texture to the resulting image. 
Flipping the image for ink to emulsion contact results in less imperfections.
Overtime the oil dries within the paper negative, becoming denser. They have a short life span, maybe a week or so. I imagine in certain conditions the oil could go rancid if long term storage was desired -but you could just print and oil another negative.

                Make /  

Having lost my canon photo printer to printhead rot, I have been using cheap/free services of 6x4 prints for my photo sketchbook. The prints are respectable for, at times, the price of postage and almost the right size for my a5 concertina sketchbook. Having used these cheap prints for weeks in my sketchbook, I started playing with the idea of making mini sketchbooks/zines/booklets for projects.
I tried Japanese stab binding, concertinas, and perfect bound techniques. These were either too awkward, time consuming, or failures - particularly perfect bound as the print papers are too thin for the application of glue. Additionally, given that I am dealing with single prints or "loose leaf",  having one print per "page" made it very limiting. 


One solution I came up with is to use postage tape and join up pages and create signatures. The tape is placed on one side and excess is cut off. 


Double sided tape is applied to the other side and pages/prints are applied, forming four pages.


These signatures are gathered in the right order and glued at the spine. You can either steal your room mates flower press or use strong clips as a substitute for a book binding press. It can take several coating of PVA glue, making sure contact is made between the signatures.


The result is a strong binding that has a flat flay.


With the accessibility of cheap book production services, is it worth the time and effort?
Probably. 
I would argue that for small side projects, sketchbooks and limited photobooks, that it is worth it. 
Doing it by hand, you have more control. You want an unconventional feature -do it. Have access to a photocopier or a convenient/cheaper source of prints? Use that. Make each edition different if you wanted. You have freedom to apply contextual patterns and themes within the project to the narrative through the physical presentation of your work.
To conclude

These zines, like their subject matter, are informal and imprecise.
There MUST be better methods for loose leaf binding, but they are obscure and the search continues.   
Cheap photo papers, by themselves, are difficult to perfect bound.
If you are making a large quantity or seek perfection, just use a cheap book production service.

Making the cyanotypes
The digital images are inverted and prepared for a4 printing. I used Permajet digital transfer film, using an inkjet printer that is not suitable and needs persuasion. 
To create the cyanotype I use an old photo frame to press the negative to the cyanotype emulsion. I leave the frame in the shade to exposure for one hour, finding that using indirect light within the shade leads to an even exposure.

I keep thinking about this work.
Tape is a common material found on Tokyo streets and train platforms. It is used as directional signage and as masking tape during construction. Over time the application of tape builds into layers of colourful textured surfaces while residual applications fade and linger without context blending into the urban interface. 
Seidenberg work composes the tape as two-dimensional surfaces. They are abstract observations with bright repetitious shapes against a variable backdrop of monotone textures.

Estovers : the right to the wood on a common. This might be whole trees or coppicing for firewood. The word Estovers derives from old french estovoir -to be necessary, and Latin est opus -there is need (collins). The etymology emphases appropriating land as a necessity.

                Sketchbook /  Noun. The subtle but persistent feeling of being out of place, as maladapted to your surroundings as a seal on a beach.
I came across this term reading Losing Eden. A lot of my work fits the concept.


Interfacial and ambiguous spaces frequently produce a similar confusing feeling. It occurs when observing an artefact foreign to the surrounding environment therefore lacking context.

The muddle of human and natural agency that is often present within  interstitial wilderness sites creates conceptual as well as physical  confusion (Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007, p. 445).

Examples taken from the above sketchbook scan: a metal post and chain on a  woodland access road, a discarded orange bag in a patch of dead ferns,  and a drain pipe obstructing a woodland view. All are examples of  juxtaposed artificial artefacts against a natural surrounding.
The opposite can also occur by observing nature within an urban  environment. For example, the Buddleja growing in the cracks of a brick  wall and pavement found at the side of a car park.
Plastic is often a source of monachopsis. I have found plastic bags, chairs, and tents in interfacial spaces.
Wind snagged dog bag in the hawthorn


Strange pieces of debris of twentieth-century capitalism seem to have some of  the capacity to inspire awe as the left-over artefacts of other ages –  like Stonehenge. Like such ancient relics, the relics of our own age now stand outside the humdrum landscape of everyday life (Shoard, 2000,  84).



When I read Shoard’s description of twentieth-century capitalist relics, I  always think back to this image I took of a burnt-out car in a field of  corn. Reflecting on the concept of monachopsis for this newsletter, I  decided to put the image to use. I found the digital file. Printed it  for the first time. Pressed it in my sketchbook. The image is fourteen  years old! Playing into the contextualization of the relic of our own age. Inadvertently I have realized I have come full circle returning to capturing scenes like these that interest me.

                Sketchbook /  I found this abandoned tent last year whilst carrying out photographic work for my masters. Since then I've made repeated visits to this [[wildscape]] between an encroaching urban housing estate, recreational field, and banal rural agrarian fields.   
In summer I captured the surrounding nature engulf the collapsed tent, only to fall in the wet autumn, and later snow in the winter. I am wondering what the long term effects are going to be. Will the freezing winter break down the plastic or will next years bramble and fern completely envelop it and grow through the material. 
Despite the passing of time and the repeated visits, I have only just started making suitable sequences. Photographic projects can be slow.
Beside the environmental documentation, the aim is part of a larger personal project escaping stale urbanity (and covid) for the liberating {marginal spaces} and their {tiers-paysage} nature. A similar contemporary narrative lifted from [[Stalker]].

In 1967 art student Richard Long caught a train from Waterloo to an unknown destination in Surrey. He ended up in a field of grass where he 'drew' a line by walking backwards and forwards repeatedly. A black and white snapshot recorded the event and has since been endlessly reproduced in diverse art publications around the world. Indeed, A Line Made by Walking is now the subject of an entire book by critic and curator Dieter Roelstraete, published by Afterall Books, London, in 2010. Deliberately. Roelstraerte meanders as he attempts to scrutinise a straight line. Some obvious contexts, such as early Conceptual Art, Land Art and Performance Art are all dealt with briskly. But he is particularly inspiring when a digression relates Long's work to the less obvious context of slapstick. Slapstick is generally defined as knockabout humour. However, Roelstraerte more specifically pinpoints a deadpan dumbness in Long's 'drawing' that he associates with Samuel Beckett and a comic actor greatly admired by Beckett, namely Buster Keaton.

PROPOSAL FOR DAVID EVANS FOR THE BOOK THE ART OF WALKING: A FIELD GUIDE. BLACK DOG PUBLISHING, 10a ACTON STREET, LONDON, WC1X 9NG, UNITED KINGDOM. June 2012.
I propose to walk exactly one kilometre whilst carrying my 35mm film camera. The one kilometer walk would start when the first photograph is taken, then every 27.77 steps I will stop, place the camera up to my left eye and take a single photograph of whatever is in front of me at that exact point.
The walk would be regulated by my own locomotion and gait, and also recorded by 36 photographs of the journey from start to finish.

Zone is the story of a city at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It is also the story of a city marked by a film. New rules were changing the old ways forever. The city had seen many changes. The pictures are the story of a city (Tallinn) haunted by the image of a film. The film ([[Stalker]]) tells the story of a writer and a scientist who go into an alien zone, where it is said a room exists in which your deepest desire will be granted. After the aliens had left many still feared this zone and its strange logic that few knew or understood. The zone could turn against you; it altered when someone moved through it, and so people found it hard to orient themselves within it. A guide was needed, the stalker, who volunteered to take the writer and scientist into the zone.

Titled Flâneur, the French term for an observer of contemporary urban life,  Connor returned to his hometown as a visitor. He engaged nostalgic urban scenery with a psychogeographic methodology capturing candid street  photography and banal new topographic imagery.

Gardens are always interesting cultural spaces, they say a lot about their custodian.

The photographer and Flâneur: Susan Sontag defines the photographer as an armed flâneur seeking the subversive underlining rather than the  authorities suggested identity. The armed flâneur is an archetype  photographer dating to the medium's inception.

The work is a re-examination of unwanted nuisance plants (weeds) as an assortment of versatile species and a valuable resource that is beneficial for our connection to nature as well as a food source for wildlife. 
The methodology follows the re-examination with a conceptual play of circumventing traditional botanical cyanotype printing for the less recognizable lumen process.

Each document has ideas, experiments, and invitations. Some are in The Lonely Planet Guide to Experimental Travel, and this collection can be seen as an extension of the book.
Examples:

ALTERNATING-TRAVEL
Leave your home on foot. Take the first road on the right, then the next on the left, then the next on the right, then the next on the left, etc. Carry on until something, a no man's land, a building or a stretch of water, blocks your path and you can go no farther.
ANACHRONISTIC-TRAVEL

Travel using a means of transport that is old-fashioned or obsolete eg, sedan-chair, palankeen, galley, hackney cab, track motorcar, 2 CV, airship, etc.
Visit a foreign town using an old edition of a guidebook.

With the help of a telephone directory (internet, or other method) find a person called Ariadne in a town of your choice.
Give Mr or Ms Ariadne a call and ask him/her what his/her favourite 21 places in the town are.
Mark each place on a map and visit them in a logical order.

MONOPOLYTOURISME

Why it's interesting today
Reminds me of geocaching, pokemon go, and munzee. But unlike these, rather than being games built on top of urban environments, yellow arrow is environment focused through psychogeographical engagement. The ability to leave a message in the environment and encouraging the user to point out features with yellow arrow stickers, is the interesting concept.

                Psychogeography /  Definition
A term originating from the work of Guy Debord, situated (accident-pun) in situationism, and apart of a broad number of psychogeographical terms. 

The cool kids used to call it the dérive, the psychogeographical idea of hacking one’s mode of traveling through the city. Not so much a technique as an attitude, an active but intuitive way to alter normal patterns and ways of experiencing one’s environment that, done right, can break the malaise and rekindle wonder. Almost like surfing. The drift. Following the flow, while actively trying to get lost, and thereby creating opportunities for unexpected discovery. A trip without a plan.
(From Christopher Brown's newsletter - Lost in America) 
https://edgelands.substack.com/p/lost-in-america

Dérive's aim is to...

...[R]emedy the incompetence of guides... and to discover the places that really have no reason to exist.
Antony, Rachel  &amp;  Henry, Joel  (Eds), The  Lonely  Planet Guide to Experimental Travel, p19/20 cited by Coverley, Merlin, Psychogeography (Pocket Essential series) p74

Coverley referrers to the percipient as a dériveur, similar to flâneur.

The dérive may lack a clear destination but it is not without purpose. On the contrary  the dériveur is conducting a psychogeographical investigation and is expected to return home having noted the ways in which the areas traversed resonate with particular moods and ambiences.
Coverley, Merlin, Psychogeography (Pocket Essential series) p96

The concept, accepting or disregarding the hints of philosophical-emotional hyperbole regardless, is a practical methodology to subvert monotonous urban environments for unexpected/unplanned situations. 
Application during 2020/21 pandemic restrictions
Frequent covid restrictions in my area have meant that daily walks to the [[edgelands]] have become an important escape -from stale suburbia and information overload. These daily unplanned wanderings have similarities with the dérive methodology. The results -dérive like unexpected occurrences have spawned projects like [[unoccupied]].
